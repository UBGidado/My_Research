he would make me trust him again Months later I found out he is talking to a girl over the internet and he even met her and when I asked him if he knew her he said no again lie to me in my face looking at my eyes After that he went away in a trip and disappear for the whole trip without trying to reach me and also told me that his phone didn’t have coverage there that’s why he didn’t take it…(another lie!),0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

 My husband and I are both nurses We have two sons Our oldest will turn five in May and our second son will turn one in April My husband works full time while I stay home with the kids Tonight I caught our 4-year-old wearing my thong underwear under his pajamas It turns out he stashed some of my underwear in his room along with two of my Victoria’s Secret catalogs We talked to him about this I have always noticed evidence of what Freud calls the oedipal complex in my son He is a smart boy and has adapted quite well to his new role as big brother He has said “why did God not make me into a girl” but when I explore this it turns out that what he really means is that he likes girls including mommy because girls are pretty I have never seen any other “feminine” tendencies in him (he’ll say pink is for girls and refuse to ride a Barbie bike) but I just want to make sure that this is just a normal phase for him and we shouldn’t be thinking about gender issues here I imagine a 4 year old won’t see this as a social taboo although it would be a different situation in an older kid Please share your views about this situation Thank you very much,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Hi I am having a tough go in my marriage We met when both of us were recovering from a breakup My now husband was going through a divorce and hindsight he probably needed more time to “heal” We moved in together after dating one year and then married a year later A few months before the wedding I began to notice his irritability with me and his depression We would fight and argue and never resolve I felt that I couldn’t talk to him about anything because he would get defensive and either not engage at all or get very angry My husband has now started Zoloft (about 3 mos) and he sees a separate counselor We went to a couple’s counselor for a year and unfortunately she thought it best to go to another therapist being we weren’t getting anywhere and she thought we needed someone more “direct and a structured approach” Last night we started with another therapist who is focused on EFT After the session I brought something up at dinner and my husband again got defensive and later angry It’s easier to not “talk” to him at all I am torn being we have only been married for 7 months and the road seems very long We are not getting our emotional mental or physical needs met Would you recommend a certain type of counselor?,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Now I’m in a relationship for almost 4 years with a 25 year old The first 2 years we had a long distance relationship but now we mostly live together Now besides all my personal problems I have also relationship issues I am terribly afraid of penetrative sex and already have been trying for 2 years or more to do something but without any results Only once we got farther than usual and I felt a little pain I even went to a psychologist but it didn’t help much Though we have intimacy and I understand that I shouldn’t have such irrational fear I just can’t handle myself it’s like my brain turns off when he just approaches me and I tense up can’t relax try to keep distance and begin to tremble breathe faster,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

But she just won’t see a doctor I have set up appointments for her only to fail in getting her to go- she just refuses and makes up an excuse like ‘I’m feeling tired’ or ‘I’m busy’ The few times she has set up appointments have been the same- she just doesn’t go When she’s physically sick she will go but won’t tell the doctor about her mental health because she feels embarrassed and awkward to tell a stranger about it I can’t afford to have a doctor come to her and neither can my parents Even my parents don’t seem that concerned about her they just complain that she has no job even though that’s the least of the problems and a mere symptom of her mental health issues I just don’t know what to do It’s also hard because she seems to be dependent on me as I’m the only social contact she really has When I went away on holiday for a month she complained to me that she missed me and I needed to come home I want to be there for her,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

My mother’s main principle in life is honesty She taught my sisters and I to be loyal and always honest My respect for her has dropped drastically since I discovered her affair with my sister’s sports coach Through messages they send nude images and sext constantly to the point where she refuses to go anywhere without her phone because she fears someone will catch her or because their affair has completely taken all her interest I was sitting on the couch a couple months ago with my phone beside me coincidentally beside my mothers It buzzed and believing that it was mine (we both have white iPhones) I pressed the home button to view the text message It was an explicit picture of his genitals with a dirty caption and hundreds of winky faces It was most definitely NOT my dad ,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
so I went great lengths to boost his trust (without him knowing I know his insecurities) I had no result whatsoever Lately I have found a forum where he is posting and saying that there is nothing more “soul crushing” than to be a manlet Problem is his insecurities affect me too I am hurt that he feels this way I am sad and I feel I don’t suffice Even worse I can’t trust him and I feel the need of snooping–only sometimes– to make sure he doesn’t do something harmful to us,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

My husband of 18 years left a year ago with no warning He had demonstrated some strange behaviour during this time but he is very secretive and deceitful and can hide things very well Within a week of leaving his family of five children he lost his job Prior to this he had been very successful in work The past five years however he has changed jobs many times although I don’t think I have been told the real reason He now doesn’t see his children at all — one of these is a tiny baby and was less than three months when he left Before this he was a loving father Since leaving he has not paid any financial support for his children although he is adamant that he has He tells so many lies it is difficult to keep track I believe that he believes his lies as he is so convincing He tells lies that serve no purpose and are easily proven to be lies yet he seems convinced they are true He is also completely paranoid and accuses people of being out to get him He comes from a family with an alcoholic father which has never been acknowledged My problem is that because we have split up I have no influence over him at all His family won’t acknowledge that there is a problem even though his behavior is completely out of character I risk looking like a bitter ex wife even though I am extremely worried about him and I know something has happened to trigger this behavior He has gone from being a well respected father and family man to not seeing any of his children or his old friends He has tattooed himself which he would never have done and he has run up huge debts I am worried he will end up arrested He has had violent out bursts but only towards me as far as I know Does it sound like he has a mental health problem?,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
