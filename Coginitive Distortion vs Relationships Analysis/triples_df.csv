After that we had trust issues and I told him that he would need to help me out to solve that and he said yeah he would make me trust him again Months later I found out he is talking to a girl over the internet and he even met her and when I asked him if he knew her he said no again lie to me in my face looking at my eyes After that he went away in a trip and disappear for the whole trip without trying to reach me and also told me that his phone didn’t have coverage there that’s why he didn’t take it…(another lie!) after all that I broke up with him…I think he doesn’t respect me because he is always adding girls on myspace and trying to meet girls…we meet 5 months after we broke up and now he is asking me for a second chance…we had sex once after the breakup I think he only looks for me whenever he wants to have sex…I still have feelings for him that’s why I always end up accepting whatever he says but I know it is not good… What do I do? Should I give him a second chance or just forget about him? He says he is gonna make it up that he has change an that now he is more mature but he had lied and hurt me so much that I feel that I love him but I have some anger towards him for making me cry so many times…why do I keep getting back with him every time he does something that hurts me?

204,1056,My brother’s always been a shy child but he had a good relationship with family and friends In his teenage years he started to withdraw I was the only one to whom he kept talking He began to spend most of the day in his bedroom He also began to use monosyllable words to reply to my parents aunts cousins… Never started a conversation unless you addressed him Now at 19 (almost 20) it has evolved to the point he doesn’t talk to anybody not even to me and not even with monosyllables He doesn’t look anybody in the face either (he didn’t do that a few years ago) If I try to talk to him he ignores me or makes a sound of annoyance and kicks me out of his bedroom He is very childish too in the sense that it is part of his routine to watch cartoons with his favorite stuffed toys (he refuses to throw toys away) He prefers their company to that of people I don’t even know if he has friends He certainly avoids his college peers He has dinner alone and goes to sleep early (I bet it is only to avoid us too) He only goes out if he needs to get a book in the library or if he has to go to college Otherwise you’ll find him home Is he afraid to become an adult? Could that be the reason he behaves like a child despite being almost 20? Could he have social anxiety? Autism even? Maybe Aspergers Some symptoms coincide: • Difficulty to socialize and make friends isolation • Rigid routines (he gets distressed if he can’t follow them) • Fear of change (he doesn’t want to throw old/broken things away) • Hygiene issues (he rarely showers and shaves and he never uses deodorant) • Sensitivity to noises and light • Repetitive motor mannerisms (which he didn’t have as a child) If he had autism though he would have some speech difficulties wouldn’t he? He actually uses sarcasm and understands it perfectly Never shown any speech delay either Besides I think I read someone is born autistic so he can’t become autistic at the age of 18 It’s been an evolution that’s why I’m not sure what is going on Is he just a very immature teenager or does he have a condition?

220,1083,Recently I have been consumed by certain fantasies and lack of empathy When I see people in the street I wonder what it would be like to kill them(mostly out of boredom) and I have thought of ways I would do it – I’m particularly intrigued by poison or psychologically engineering a suicide because it’s quite passive(not violent/bloody) However I don’t think I would ever do anything to hurt anyone to be honest I think 1) out of laziness and 2) I would want to be 100% sure I would get away with it I’m an INTJ personality so I am meticulously organized and analytical I have recently been very withdrawn socially and realized my relationships with people/conversations are quite superficial and I do it just because I sometimes need friends However while I feel like I can switch my empathy ‘off’ (stop caring) I do care very deeply for some people and I love helping my loved ones and making their lives better So I don’t understand why I can be a caring person as well as regularly lack empathy / feel superficially charming and manipulative and have fantasies are urges to hurt people? I’ve taken the Hare psychopathy checklist and scored 29 but like I said I can feel empathy when I want to so I’m not sure that’s really accurate Please let me know what you think and any advice (I know this isn’t clinical advice and I don’t think I need professional help its not THAT bad) But still appreciate any thoughts (From England),"('care', 'I', 'people')",care,0,Supportive Actions,No Distortion,

521,1600, It started recently when I was finishing up my sophomore year of high school I began to become increasingly paranoid (I thought people were out to get me and that people kept staring at me even if I was alone) that people could hear my thoughts and I kept feeling like there was some sort of presence near me and/or following me Not only that but I would have the occasional auditory hallucination I didn’t hear voices but rather noises people make such as breathing (as if someone were right next to me)r when I was alone (happened twice) a snarl (also as if someone were right next to me) and an exhale (right next to me alone)  however these are minor compared to the visual hallucinations These occurred in the corner of my eye I would see moving shadows full blown people (I would see them moving sand they would be extremely detailed but when I looked back they were never there in the first place[this occurred 3 times]) and sometimes pictures would look like they were moving or finishing an action Some of my other visual hallucinations I could see directly such as a face at the top of a door (occurred once) and one time I was sitting in drivers Ed and my teacher was talking about bugs when all of the sudden I see two black dots swarming around her head like flies but it didn’t last long until they flew behind her head and disappeared Another time I was sitting in a car and I saw a fly fly right up to my face so I swatted at it but I realized that there wasn’t actually a fly because I couldn’t find it anywhere neither did I hear the buzzing of its wings Another instance is when I thought I saw a bug crawling down my arm but I didn’t feel it nor did I see it where it should have ended up Another time u thought I saw a bug crawling across my wall but again I didn’t see it where it was suppose to end up (on the ceiling it was crawling up) Not only that but when I walked down the hallways of my school they would appear to be crooked and moving causing me to walk funny Then there is other stuff like my loss of motivation emotion (not flat effect) I would miss letters when I wrote I began talking to my inner voice as if it were real (it talked to me first) I now have a bad attention span and it’s now fairly hard to get my point across because I’ll get tongue tied plus my personal hygiene is not the best and my memory (especially short term) seems to be increasingly getting worse That last part could be due to my dysthymia but it still doesn’t explain the rest of the things I’ve been experiencing I never have and never will use drugs and I don’t take any medications Thank you for your time,"('miss', 'I', 'letters')",miss,1,Interpersonal Beliefs / Emotions,No Distortion,

Before I turned 10 my childhood was good and I have fond memories of my family hanging out / doing activities together However after reaching the age of 10 my father just stopped bothering to spend time with his children Over the years he acts like he wants to hang out but when time rolls around for the activity to take place always comes up with excuse to not hang out (be it family activities or spending time with individual family members) This obviously hurt my feelings as a child (mainly because I would try to follow things up) and he would always get angry at me I’m now a 29 year old adult and he still claims to want to hang out from time to time However I really don’t believe him and get annoyed with this behavior because I know he won’t follow through Problem I have is not that he won’t hang out If he doesn’t value his family enough to spend time with them that’s fine But he acts like everyone else is to blame for this (even though he suggests hanging out and other people have to follow up to see if event is really taking place),"('neglect', 'parent', 'time')",neglect,2,Relational Harm,No Distortion,

607,1730,I have been in a relationship with Steven for over a year now and he is only beginning to open up about his parents He is 17 and lives with his parents currently and they come from a very low income family When I go over to his house his father is always drunk yelling at the tv or his granddaughter in profane language His mother has never shown an ounce of intrest in him when im there and has not even bothered to enroll him back into highschool after he was expelled when a student attacked him He has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and ADHD and was on pills for sometime but his parents took him off for some reason…They dont have health insurance for him and he hasn’t been to a doctor in over 2 years It has gotten to the point where he is going to ask his grandmother if she can take him to the doctor He also has this randomly recurring excruciating pain in his ribs every so oftenlasting anywhere from a minute to several hours since he was a child and no doctor could diagnose it i think it may be all the extreme stress…He went through tremendous physical abuse at a younger age and constant moving from home to home I want to help him get past this and heal his emotional wounds so he can make a great life for himself Last night he was going through a really rough time and actually scared me with what he expressed about his feelings He has no other family members in town other than his two adult sisters that moved into an apartment together 10 minutes away… however he cannot stay there because they recently had a baby and the boyfriend is living with them his parents continuously put him down and tell him how worthless he is and how they’re kicking him out the second he turns 18 He says he just wants parents who ask how you’re feeling say i love you and how your day was… but he has never had that he comes home to drinking and smoking and screaming This past week he has started his first job working for a contracting company doing under the table work like hanging dry wall and packing mud he is really exited to be making money and i want to help him figure out a savings plan so he can move out when he turns 18 im sorry this is so long i just wanted to tell you the whole situation and i just want someone to give me some advise on how to help him move on from his parents and love himself It tears me apart to see him go through this and know this is all hes ever known,"('love', 'i', 'you')",love,1,Interpersonal Beliefs / Emotions,No Distortion,

614,1742,My fiance and I have been together for 4 years About a year into our relationship I had to take a break from it because I had a history of violent sexual abuse that I had to get help for and our relationship was hard for me to participate in during that time About 3 months into our break we started going out on dates and working toward getting back to normal but we were not officially together During this time of dating and him pursuing me he had sex with another girl 3 years passed and he never told me about the incident — since that happened we had moved in together and he asked me to marry him I recently found out about the sex because he left his email logged on to my computer and he was emailing her an apology for his poor behavior with her This is the first time he has been physical with another girl but during other parts of our relationship I have caught him sexting his ex and at one point I found him texting one of his peers at school telling her that he didn’t get enough attention from me and he wanted to kiss her and see if she was the thing missing from his life I don’t know how to proceed with him I love him very much and our wedding is in 2 years but I’m not sure after all of this if it is even worth the work it will be to fix our relationship So should we work it out or should throw in the towel?,"('love', 'I', 'him')",love,1,Interpersonal Beliefs / Emotions,No Distortion,

620,1751,My husband suffers from depression which manifests as anger and he is emotionally/verbally abusive I am trying to help him work through everything but his mother is making it harder When I talk to her about our problems she says stuff like “Well he just has a short temper like his father” or “Well he wouldn’t ever talk to me that way” Also his parents are the main reason for his mental instability It’s a long story but he had a very rough childhood because of his parents’ choices She acts like mom-of-the-year while I am stuck trying to work through my husband’s and my problems without losing my sanity How can I make her understand that a) she’s not helping b) her son really DOES have a problem (beyond his depression) and c) that it’s serious and not something to brush off? When I talk to her about my husband and my arguments her first instinct is always to ask “Should I call him?” No that won’t help Why would it? Its frustrating that she passive-aggressively blames me for his/our problems Its frustrating that she thinks she can help him when I can’t I’ve been with my husband for 5 years going on 6 (married for almost 2) She doesn’t see the real side of him Which brings up another question I’ve been struggling with – Why does he only verbally abuse me and not his mother or anyone else in his family? Why do I get all of the anger and abuse when I’m the one trying the hardest to help him and the one with the deepest connection to him? He tells me all the time it’s his mother’s fault for his problems and how she makes things worse but of course he would never tell her that So she gets to continue thinking she has nothing to do with his problems because it’s only me who he treats this way I will also add that we have all been to see a therapist My husband and I have gone together but I don’t feel like he’s taking the treatments seriously yet and his mother and brother went once together His mother and brother spent their entire session talking about my husband and his problems…not their own problems or how is family has and is contributing to his problems,"('help', 'she', 'b')",help,0,Supportive Actions,No Distortion,

631,1769,Hi I have a history of having a relatively short temper normally this is just shouting or nothing serious But occasionally when I get angry I lash out physically so I’ll hit walls or pull on my hair but I’ve never hurt anyone and it’s always been in private so no one knows this has been happening About a month ago my girlfriend told me something that made me angry I could feel myself getting angry and started to pace around her room she could she I was distressed and got up to comfort me but in that moment I needed space so I pushed her away onto her bed She wasn’t hurt she was just shocked I hadn’t even realised I’d done it Anyway I calmed down in the end and we’ve carried on as normal But recently we spoke about the incident again and she told me that she’s now constantly afraid to get me angry in fear that I might hurt her or go further than just pushing her away I love her and she’s the last person I want to hurt and it kills me that I’ve given her a reason to think these things I just wanted to ask the question here firstly to see if you think this is a serious anger issue that would benefit from speaking to a therapist or going on a course or something And if there’s anything I can do in the meantime to make things better Maybe techniques that can calm me down I genuinely don’t think I could ever hurt her she is the most important thing in the world to me But it scares me that I didn’t realise I had pushed her All I want is to be someone that she feels safe around and to be the best I can be for her Any help of advice would be much appreciated (age 18 from US),"('love', 'I', 'her')",love,1,Interpersonal Beliefs / Emotions,No Distortion,

769,1915,Hi there my mother was diagnosed with Bipolar about four years ago after years of misdiagnoses She has been on Risperidone for about 4 years now and has usually been okay But in the last year she’s had two episodes not full-blown but bad enough to cause us all stress (her family) I have two questions today: Does this mean the medication is no longer working? And secondly her symptoms are listed anywhere as being Bipolar symptoms so I’m wondering whether you can shed some light She often speaks French when she’s having an episode A language she never speaks nor does she speak it correctly it’s almost as if she’s making up words She then puts on a French accent when speaking English and cannot pronounce her R’s anymore She also acts unlike herself by singing constantly or mumbling under her breath as she’s walking around the house It’s been like this for a week now and she’s taking one Risperidone a day…is any of this characteristic of Bipolar Disorder? She obviously has the paranoia and the delusions that someone is looking at her or whatever I’m 27 years old and she’ll act like I’m her 5 year old daughter if we walk outside or in the streets as if I might get kidnapped Please help! I am deeply saddened and stress just caring for her Any advice would be much appreciated! Thank you,"('care', 'I', 'her')",care,0,Supportive Actions,No Distortion,

1082,3528,"Since I was about 16 years old I’ve had these “spells” where it’s impossible for me to control my emotions. They come on suddenly and with absolutely no triggers whatsoever, although for hours to days before they happen I’ll sometimes have uncomfortably high levels of energy–I’ll feel either obnoxious and silly (but in a kind of desperate way, if that makes sense) or I’ll be really productive and jittery. Both of these high energy feelings are unsettling, maybe because I normally almost never have high levels of energy. The “spells,” “episodes,” whatever they are, involve extreme guilt and disgust with myself–but it’s a very visceral feeling and it’s overwhelming. I feel trapped inside my disgusting self and like I’m willing to do anything to escape it. I feel incredibly agitated and yet trapped at the same time–like I want to move or do something but I can’t. I also just feel extremely empty and sad–like, I’m filled with this overwhelming emotion but other than that I’m hollow. I feel so desperate and so unhappy and sick and like I hate myself so much–but it’s such a powerful physical feeling that it’s hard to describe with words because it’s a feeling and not a thought. I sob uncontrollably during these episodes (they usually last a few hours although they occasionally last longer) I’ve definitely been suicidal during these periods, but it’s not so much a conscious desire to kill myself than it is a need to escape how I’m feeling. I’m just afraid sometimes that since I’m not really thinking during these times that I might do something to myself–especially since I think during these times that I don’t deserve to get help or that I’m not worth disturbing people by calling them.","('hate', 'I', 'myself')",hate,1,Interpersonal Beliefs / Emotions,Labeling,Emotional Reasoning

Two years back I realized that I love him unconditionally and what all we shared was not merely friendship but I had other feelings for him. First I thought the feelings were mutual and so did all our common friends told me. But when I proposed the GUY, he refused me and said he never felt so. And everybody, including his brother and cousin who are my good friends too, have taken his feelings for me wrongly. He was just a friend to me always and had no such feelings for me.

Two years back I realized that I love him unconditionally and what all we shared was not merely friendship but I had other feelings for him. First I thought the feelings were mutual and so did all our common friends told me. But when I proposed the GUY, he refused me and said he never felt so. And everybody, including his brother and cousin who are my good friends too, have taken his feelings for me wrongly. He was just a friend to me always and had no such feelings for me. He certainly stopped talking to me. No contacts at all for 8 months. But I still loved him n I still do. I was always concerned about him.

His mother began emailing jokes to my fiancé and me and we noticed that there were a couple other people on the emails including an ex girlfriend, who he dated for a short period of time. My fiancé asked his mother if she was still in contact with her and she said yes that they email occasionally. He told her that it made him uncomfortable and thought that it was disrespectful to both he and I and that it would hurt my feelings. She responded very harshly by saying she wouldn’t be told who she could talk to. And that if I was that fragile than she would never be close to me any way because she would not want to have a relationship with someone that she needs to sensor what she says because of my feelings. She then deleted me from her email contacts and kept the ex. She said that she would also be a friend with another ex-gf, who had been very rude and nasty to me early on in our relationship, if she was given the chance. I felt like the response was totally irrational, mean and disrespectful. I felt extremely hurt. Her response hurt even more than the actual emailing itself. I had always been very nice and respectful of his mother. My fiancé has been very supportive and says that he would feel just as hurt and uncomfortable if the tables were turned and it were my mother behaving in this manner. All we wanted was for some respect for our feelings. It hurt to see this relationship flaunted in front of me and then to have my future mother in-law blatantly not care less about our feelings and choose to maintain a relationship with the ex and not her future daughter in-law.

1099,3541," My husband and I have been together for almost 10 years and have one child. We are very openminded and compatible sexually, though our sex life has been through some ups and downs as we have grown as people and experienced child birth and child rearing. The first few years of our relationship, we did some wild things sexually, such as public sex, group sex, voyeurism, etc. We both enjoyed ourselves and were equally involved and responsible for our actions. During and after the pregnancy and birth of our child, however, our sex life went through some drastic changes, and we found ourselves with some sexual issues to work through. One of these issues was my newfound disinterest in our old wild ways; motherhood had turned my viewpoint on it from fun to irresponsible. We have gotten over most of the awkwardness that made its way into our bed, but now we are presented with a somewhat „gray area‰ issue. Over the past year or so, my husband has been visiting sexual video chat sites and broadcasting himself in various sexual states, most of the time masturbating, in both public and private online communications. At first he did this secretly, until I found out in a very startling way; I investigated the website that kept appearing in our computer‚s browser history on my phone at work, and was shocked to find a live public video feed of my husband fully aroused. After some obvious conflict over the discovery, we discussed it, and he told me that he missed having our „wild sex life‰ and that this helps fulfill that need. He asked if I would participate, and I agreed in hopes of helping to satisfy his sexual mentality. We broadcast ourselves having sex online a few times, having up to 1000 people watch, which completely turned my husband on and completely turned me off. I decided I wasn‚t going to join him again due to the uneasy feeling it gave me which kept me from enjoying myself. Ever since, I have known in the back of my mind that he still does this, and have gotten up in the middle of the night a few times to find him masturbating and video chatting publicly or with females who are at least scantily clad, if not nude and masturbating themselves. When I confront him about it, he says he has a public sex fetish and needs to fulfill it, believing that it helps keep him „faithful‰ to me since I am no longer interested. (Something you should know about my husband; he is a popular musician and is often confronted with opportunities for sex at shows, but I am confident that he hasn‚t cheated on me). It is obviously a disturbing experience to get up and find him doing this, and although he is not physically cheating, I still feel hurt and disrespected on these occasions. I basically want an outsider‚s point of view on whether I should accept this as part of the man I fell in love with and married, reject it on the grounds of how I feel (although I have a hard time with the thought of leaving him over it), or if we should try to work out some sort of compromise. I would like to come up with some way where he can feel fulfilled and I can be a part of it, without making me uncomfortable, but haven’t been able to (not asking you to figure out what that would be for me, just mentioning it). Thank you very much for your time and help with this issue.","('accept', 'I', 'this')",accept,0,Supportive Actions,Personalization,

1101,3543," I read a question that was similar to the one I have, but I did not believe it could fully be used for my situation. Both my girlfriend and me are 20 years of age. We have been together since July 2nd 2010, and it is March 28th 2011. We were friends for many years before we started dating but due to both of us moving around we were not able to have a relationship. She is everything I ever wanted in a woman and I am so happy to have her in my life. I had no sexual interactions what so ever before I was with her, she is my first in everything. Unfortunately, I am not her first in many things, if anything at all, and that is very hurtful and distressing to me. When she was growing up her parents neglected and even abused her. She was molested on several occasions, but never by a family member. Her life has not been one of happiness and is full of past pains that plague her to this day. She never felt loved or cared about by anyone, and sought out relationships to fill this void. Her first sexual experience was with a female, they were friends and one night during a sleep over her friend put her hand down my girlfriends pants and began feeling around down there. My girlfriend said she did it back to her friend. She was bisexual for a while and dated a few girls, but never did anything for that kiss them. Though not often she claims. Her first sexual experience with a boyfriend was when she was 14 and the guy she was dating asked her to “touch him”, and so she did. She says she didn’t want to but did it to make him happy. In her next relationship she let him suck on her breasts and finger her, she touched him but while he had pants on so there was no contact with his penis. In her third relationship she also let him finger her and she gave him a hand job as well. In her last relationship she went out with this guy for 2.5 years and she really loved him. He was the first she gave oral sex to, and they did everything together. He fingered her; she gave him many hand jobs and lots of oral sex. She wanted to have sex and so did he, but she brought it up to him. They agreed and she claims that he only penetrated her a little bit before finishing, so she doesn’t believe she lost her virginity. He claims that every time they tried, which both him and her say was 3 times, that they had full intercourse but she swears that after that first time having failed, and the other two times they never got past being naked, none of the times they ever had full intercourse. I don’t know if she’s trying to protect me because she knows how bad it would hurt me if they actually did, or if she really didn’t have full on sex with him. I know her was able to penetrate her at least somewhat so I also have issues with whether she was still a virgin the first time we had sex.","('love', 'she', 'him')",love,1,Interpersonal Beliefs / Emotions,Mind Reading,

1117,3557,"As I’ve been becoming older, I’ve been getting into arguments with my parents. But recently they’ve been happening more and more frequently and I’ve been getting more and more angry each time. Each argument has been about the same major topics: my behavior towards my siblings or how I “disrespect” my parents. But sometimes I can’t help what I say to my parents. If they’re in my face yelling about what I just said or how I forgot to do something, how can I not yell back? My parents say its disrespect, but I feel that they have no respect for me when they’re yelling in my face. But the topic we argue most about is my little brother. He’s 7 and if I do the slightest thing to him he goes and tells and I get the whole “you’re older and need to grow up speech”. I’m sick of it. I feel that they can’t see that my little brother does things that really bother me, and I’m not being dramatic. Like today, my little brother does this thing where he just touches me. I HATE when he does this because it’s COMPLETELY unnecessary. So I hit him back, not that hard just a slap in the arm. Just so happens my dad was walking by at the same exact time. When he saw this he immediately got in my face, hit my arm (and I had to fight back the urge to hit my dad right back), and started giving me a speech (which during I was completely being a smart aleck because I felt this whole thing was not my fault). When my mother got home I got the same speech from her, but she just didn’t understand how I felt! Then while I was in the room right next to the kitchen they started to discuss what they should do to that “devil”. But my defense is that my little brother is just very dumb and a wimp and that my parents baby him too much. But to avoid these confrontations I feel the only way to do this is to COMPLETELY IGNORE my whole family. I’ve been doing this by sleeping all day and my schoolwork is suffering, I also barely eat because of sleeping all day. But these arguments always seem to find their way into my life. Is there any way to get my parents to understand me? How do I deal with 7-year-old brother? Can I just keep ignoring them? Please do not treat his as a teenager being dramatic, this is a serious cry for help. After some of these arguments I’ve hurt myself. I scratched my arm with tweezers and today I dug my own nails into my arm. Some of these arguments have resulted in me almost getting smacked in the face by my dad. I’ve also cried for hours before. So please I’m begging for help.","('understand', 'parents', 'me')",understand,0,Supportive Actions,Emotional Reasoning,All-or-nothing thinking

He was very supportive, which I needed, and he knows me very well. I felt i had gone as far as I could with him on problems I was haveing with ADHD problems and problems with schooling. I felt bad for him that I just kept failing to improve.

1264,3709,"I know there have been many in my situation, but I have yet to find a submission that has presented a clear answer to help with my situation. In October 2009 my wife found out I was cheating with a co-worker. I did not feel comfortable telling her all of the details at first so I continued lying as I felt I was protecting her already fragile state. I have been a liar since I can remember and I don’t know how to stop. I realize I personally make the decision to lie every time I do it, but that doesn’t seem to get in the way when it comes down to making a decision whether or not to lie. We have severe financial problems and will more than likely lose our home. My wife has told me we won’t be married after she graduates from nursing school but we haven’t separated yet because we have 3 children together and she doesn’t have an income. I have been getting payday loans to subsidize my income and have paid a significant amount towards those loans to keep things as normal as possible for the kids. So goes the lying. I get loans my wife doesn’t know about to keep things normal and she always finds out I have been getting money somewhere and I end up telling her the truth. She says I am childish for always lying and adds what I’ve done to the list of reasons we are getting divorced. I told her tonight I fear for my life sometimes because she doesn’t seem to have control over herself when she is in a fit of rage over what I’ve done. She has made comments in the past that she would “stab me” and she would “get off” if she were to kill me (because I cheated). I know what I did to her was terrible and I feel like a terrible person every day. I live in a manic world to keep myself from going off the deep end. I have been told I can’t leave my house because I will be abandoning my children and the courts will not award any custody to me if I do. She, however, wants me to leave immediately.

Like memories of me and my ex and times in the phsyc hospital I was in three times because I felt safe there. I take it daily so I can see her face(even while we were together cause we just started to fall atpart the last 3or4 months.), be safe in the hospital environment, and fix things iv screwed up in the past. The bad thing is it makes my psychosis worse. Iv already attempted suicid twice, but the first time my friend stopped me before I took all the pills and the second time my ex from above called me as I had the gun in my mouth, and I felt it was a sign that I had to stay alive for her.

1277,3716," Hi, I have been seeing the same therapist for about 4 years. She recently told me that she was increasing her fees, because she has needs too. I take a lot of trips, and she stated, I have clients who are always taking trips and do not pay their bill. I told her, I pay my bill. Then she said, if I dont increase your fee then I am enabling you.? And that I need to decide what is more important, therapy or trips. She also stated that she feels like she has to walk on eggshells with me, and that she needs time off. I always believed that therapist were healthy with appropriate coping skills. She seems to blame me for things, and when I bring something up, she denies it. I feel like she has been fake, and is suddently resenting me. I would have appreciated her being honest with me. All I said to her was, if she increases my rate then I will come every other week instead of weekly. And I told her that I felt like I was too dependent on her. I feel connected to her because I have shared soo much about myself to her, but I’m not sure I want to continue therapy with her. I originally went to her for substance abuse and it has been a long road to recovery. She probably feels discouraged. I tend to be brutally honest and perhaps that made her mad at me? Resentful that I am taking vacations and she cant. Anyways I am having hard time with this and cant stop thinking about the things she accused me of.

I worked my way up to 167 last year and tried to get down to 140 for prom. I diddnt succeed and i ended up eating so much i gained 10 of the 20 lbs i lost and then over summer after i got diagnose with celiacs disease i diddnt eat very much, there would be days i just skipped food all together. everyday at the pool more and more guys would look and I felt more confident. when i went to my doctor for my celiacs doctor about a month ago, she said that my weight concerned her. apparently 140 is the lowest my body can be without being unhelthy and i weighed in at 142. I still didnt feel it was enough and about 2 weeks ago i discovered that if i take my adhd medicine everyother day not only can i slack off when i really want to but i get sick and then im not hungry. I went down to 140.2 for about 4 days and i felt like a fat kid. In gym I couldnt run as fast as normal and i was out of breath in no time, when we got back i looked in the mirror and saw how gross i looked. my boyfriend thinks im self destructive in ways other that not eating because he sees me eating apples and rice bars alot and thinks its the only healthy thing i do for my body since i stopped cutting.But he dosnt understand either way and dosnt seem to notice either way so i figure hes happy about thedirection of my figure. I couldnt get my meds to make me sick anymore last week so i stopped taking them and i just ate everything with sugar or chocolate or fat and went up to 147 and it freaked me out.

I lost my virginity to him I n a triumphany victory because I though after we made love that he would be all mine, what a sick thought in reflection, although the most intense sex ive ever had. We are highly sexual with each other still. I even cater to his extreme foot fetish and bdsm although afterwards every time I feel so dirty and putrid. what a paradox, pain mixed with pleasure, so confusing. its to the point now where other guys don’t turn me on anymore.

This is what’s making me confused. Once I’ve hurt someone, mostly emotionally, I wouldn’t feel guilty, even after my feelings for them have returned (after calming down). I’ve also realized that I’m very manipulative and dominant, I hate it whenever I feel like I’m not in control. I become more aggressive. And once something doesn’t go my way, I play as the victim or I try to make the person feel guilty or pity me so that they can give in. I don’t lie often, mostly because I don’t feel the need to since I don’t do bad things, I don’t mind following the rules as I think that they’re fair and don’t interfere with my life.

I’ve been told that I can be cruel at times, I do admit that I am, especially towards people I dislike. I also feel satisfaction in seeing them hurt.

1312,3759,"My brother’s always been a shy child, but he had a good relationship with family and friends. In his teenage years, he started to withdraw. I was the only one to whom he kept talking. He began to spend most of the day in his bedroom. He also began to use monosyllable words to reply to my parents, aunts, cousins… Never started a conversation unless you addressed him. Now, at 19 (almost 20), it has evolved to the point he doesn’t talk to anybody, not even to me, and not even with monosyllables. He doesn’t look anybody in the face either (he didn’t do that a few years ago). If I try to talk to him, he ignores me or makes a sound of annoyance and kicks me out of his bedroom. He is very childish too, in the sense that it is part of his routine to watch cartoons with his favorite stuffed toys (he refuses to throw toys away). He prefers their company to that of people. I don’t even know if he has friends. He certainly avoids his college peers. He has dinner alone and goes to sleep early (I bet it is only to avoid us too). He only goes out if he needs to get a book in the library or if he has to go to college. Otherwise, you’ll find him home. Is he afraid to become an adult? Could that be the reason he behaves like a child despite being almost 20? Could he have social anxiety? Autism, even? Maybe Aspergers. Some symptoms coincide: • Difficulty to socialize and make friends; isolation • Rigid routines (he gets distressed if he can’t follow them) • Fear of change (he doesn’t want to throw old/broken things away) • Hygiene issues (he rarely showers and shaves and he never uses deodorant) • Sensitivity to noises and light • Repetitive motor mannerisms (which he didn’t have as a child) If he had autism, though, he would have some speech difficulties, wouldn’t he? He actually uses sarcasm and understands it perfectly. Never shown any speech delay either. Besides, I think I read someone is born autistic, so he can’t become autistic at the age of 18. It’s been an evolution, that’s why I’m not sure what is going on. Is he just a very immature teenager or does he have a condition?

1313,3760,"I’m writing for my brother who is currently 26. I am his older brother. I have been concerned about him for a long time. Growing up he had few friends and would mainly play video games by himself or online. Also growing up he was a bit bossy towards my parents and others, he was the youngest child. In college he had a short phase where he was a bit more social. It is now about 4 years since he has graduated college. In that time he has not worked any job. He gets angry when people try to tell him to think about the future and what he wants to do with his life. He lives alone in an apartment that my parents own in Queens (we live on Long Island). He barely goes outside. He orders things to his apartment, even food so he doesnt go outside (he doesn’t know how to drive either). He mainly just plays video games online and sleeps. It seems like he has some hidden form of cash flow that we do not know of since he buys himself things on Amazon quite frequently. He is extremely moody and can get in quite negative angry moods towards others. This has been 4 years and I am not sure what to do. He himself does not seem open for us trying to help, when my parents try to have a more serious talk with him he gets extremely angry and then will say extreme things to get them to stop talking, like “This will be the last you will ever see me. I will move to Sweden” (he is currently dating a girl online from Sweden who has recently come to visit him in NY). Or he will even say things like committing suicide if we try to get involved help him. We do not want him to run away to Sweden so we are not sure what to do as we feel like we are walking on thin ice over here. But he has been stuck for so long. The problem is that he doesn’t seem to care at all. I wasn’t sure what to do and would appreciate your help on how to hopefully get things on a positive path. We do not want to see him waste away his life like this any longer. What is the first step? Thank you.","('date', 'he', 'girl')",date,0,Supportive Actions,Mind Reading,

Everyone talks so much about trying to be strong but they seem to do nothing to actually feel good about themselves. They just wallow in self-pity like the world owes them.

1337,3779,"I was married 36 years to my soulmate. Our relationship wasn’t perfect but we were perfect for each other. His death was due to very critical health problems that resulted in 100 days in a hospital that ended with a massive heart attack in the hospital. I was with him when he passed. My concern is where are all the people who were there for me prior? Why do friends stop calling, etc. Prior to all this, I had a fairly good social life. However I always seemed to be the one reaching out, making dinner dates, planning get togethers. I do work full time and was my husbands caregiver for awhile, but I always made sure I made time for my friends. Now that I am alone, nobody ever reaches out, still. You would think they would realize I lost the love of my life and reach out to me. Make sure I am ok, invite me to lunch. I can count on one hand the number of friends who have checked on me. Is losing friends normal during grief? I mean even my husbands old friends, the guy who did the funeral ( a longtime friend), even my husbands family! (out of his 4 siblings, 1 has reached out) I spend a lot of time alone. I work, spend lots of time with my grandkids, but as far as a social life, its almost nothing. Part of me is angry that here I am going thru the worst thing I’ve ever experienced and where are the people who came to the funeral, said they are there for me? Why NOW is it still up to me to be the initiator? I am doing ok with the grieving process and have made great progress in the last 12 months, except for THIS. Even some co-workers ignore the situation, my own boss doesn’t even ask how I am, ever. Not once since the funeral. (I love my job and have been at my job 31 years. This last year has shown me tho, nobody wants to deal with a grieving person) I never imagined friendships would disappear after such a loss.","('love', 'I', 'job')",love,1,Interpersonal Beliefs / Emotions,Mind Reading,

I have a tendency to lie. I lack empathy most times. I find myself manipulating others for my own personal gain. I have a gnawing yearning for attention and control. But BPD explains these. What it doesn’t explain is the obsession with blood, constant visions of harming others, a lack of remorse, and dreams of violently killing people I know and strangers.

During this time I developed a crush in which I became obsessively and honestly kind of creepily attached to him which drove him away from me in the long run,(this repeated in 7th).

1375,3819,My parents & boyfriend got into a heated argument last year. He was defending me and telling them to back off because they said I abuse my cat. She has some separation anxiety and I spend time with my boyfriend once a week. They’re very negative about him but he has helped pay bills and helped my stepdad get a job but he lost it. I’m very happy with my relationship. They think he will cheat and abuse me. We also had an agreement that they would pay rent and bills since I was helping out before. Now they want me to help pay everything on top of my own bills. I tried to room with a coworker but they flipped out and didn’t want me to. We tried to work things out but I’m back to square one. I’m thinking of getting a foster for my cat and staying with my boyfriend till we can get our own place. I can’t afford my own and getting a room is risky. My boyfriend is going into air force so he wants to wait till he gets back to find a place. I’m not sure if I’m doing right but I feel the need to get away for my mental health.

I forgave him at the beginning of the relationship when I found out he cheated on me, but I have never managed to rebuild the trust. He has changed, worked really hard and is a great guy in many ways BUT one thing. The biggest issue we have is when he goes out/goes for a drink. I keep on telling him that I am unable to trust him unless he keeps me posted, comes home at a reasonable or agreed hour, answers his phone if I call him late at night. But him going out often results in us arguing as he never sticks to his word and the worst thing that he does is he disappears. What I mean by that is that he would just disappear for the whole night and not answer his phone/messages. So obviously this makes me feel really disrespected as I sit there all night waiting and going crazy worrying if he is safe, if he is with another woman, if he is injured…like there are so many things that go through my mind during those dreadfully long hours until he decides to get in touch or come home.","('forgive', 'I', 'him')",forgive,1,Interpersonal Beliefs / Emotions,Overgeneralization,

I’ve been diagnosed with generalised anxiety and have had depression in the past linked to poor self-image/esteem. My family relationships are good. I’ve had two relationships, one when 13 and the second when 15.

The second was emotionally abusive but I broke-up after a month and never wanted to reconcile. I thought about this celebrity less while in relationships but never fully stopped. Since my teen years I’ve fantasised about them: being in a relationship, conversing with them, being intimate (sexually) etc. When in a relationship with another female celebrity I became obsessed with her and still am, saving hundreds of pictures of her, watching all the interviews I could because I wanted to act, sound and look like her, eat, exercise and use the same beauty products as her if I could find that information. Whenever seeing pictures of them I feel a painful pit in my stomach. I would follow pages on instagram that followed them. After they broke up I stayed obsessed, less than initially but still, focusing more on whoever he’s currently with/dating (he’s with a regular girl now).

He is a pretty unemotional man by nature, but he is always talking with her and they have a lot of fun. He mentors her gently and speaks very kindly to her. She’s very mean to him, telling him to go and kill himself and has physically attacked both of us in the past, but he still adores her. I’ve always tried to be a good kid and played mediator between my parents when they were divorcing. I’ve gotten good grades, helped around the house, and even got accepted into a top university with a generous grant. I’m not saying that that warrants affection, but my dad can’t stand to be around me. He’s always very critical and controlling of me, to the point where I’ve begun to develop an eating disorder. He never sees my accomplishments as accomplishments and instead tears down what I’ve done. He’s always pushing me away in favor of someone else. There are times when he’d rather be with his work buddies than with me. I try to joke with him, make him smile, make him things, and generally be the best daughter I can be, but I feel as if he just feels obligated to be around me because he’s my father, not because he loves me. I feel this is because I look very much like his ex-wife, my mother. Or maybe it’s for some other reason, I really don’t know. All I’ve ever really wanted in life is for him to have some pride in me. My father is someone I look up to a lot and who I love more than anything. I would do anything for him. My family is very small. All we have is each other. I truly love both my sister and my father despite how they act, but I would like to feel that same love. I just want to know what I can do to make him love me the same way he loves my younger sister.

I didn’t have trauma in my childhood and nor did I have it at all. I know that I get angry a lot, but the rest of my emotions are “shallow”; for lack of better words. Is it because I’m detached? I have these erotic fantasies too that I’ve had for my whole life. To me they aren’t disturbing though. I thoroughly enjoy them but I don’t want to go to jail.

1404,3850,"Hey, I’ve been really struggling because I’ve been thinking about this problem a lot. So a quick background story. I am the oldest in 5 kids and my parents were married for over 15 years. I also come from a middle eastern background and a very strict religious family. So I’m not sure if anyone is going to understand how hard it is to say anything to anyone. So my dad was sick since 2011 he had a stroke that made him paralyzed on his whole left side. I was around 9 years old when he started being sick. My mom would always take care of him and stay by his side or at least that’s what I thought. But when I was 11, I started seeing my mom talk to different guy on the phone and always flirting with him. I was young and I told her mom are you talking to anyone else. But she denied it and then changed the password for her phone so I wouldn’t look at anything. I ignored it for about a year or so, now around this time, my dad was getting better and the relationship between them was great, there weren’t any problems and we almost never saw them fighting, but I still heard her talking to that guy and saw her many times meet with him when my dad wasn’t home and she always thought I didn’t know and I forgot about it. Time passed and I always ignored, I never told anything to any of my other siblings or faced her with it again. Time passed and my dad got sick again, and she was still talking to that guy in addition to 2 other guys that I knew about and they looked a lot younger than her. I would always find a way to know her password and open her chats to see all the flirty messages between her and the other guys. I always cried by myself and kept it in me since then. Speed up to two years ago, I was 14 at that time, my dad got another stroke and was really sick, he passed away. My mom continued to talk to one of the guys and I don’t know what happened to the other two. I regret not telling my dad anything. And if anyone of my uncles knows about her texts and the pictures she sends to that guy, they will kill her because it is against our religion and our culture and they are very strict. I always cry and I still look thru her phone and see all the disgusting things she says and sends to that guy. I don’t know if I should tell anyone or keep it a secret still. Oh, I forgot to mention that the guy she’s still talking is also married and has kids.(From the USA)","('marry', 'parents', 'years')",marry,1,Interpersonal Beliefs / Emotions,Mental filter,Fortune-telling

It’s gotten to the point where I’m scared to go home due to the criticism I’ll have to face from her. She bases her opinions of my boyfriend based on some text messages she read, because she literally stole my phone and figured out my password, she crossed the line and invaded my privacy. She is now making me choose between my boyfriend or them, and honestly if she thinks that my boyfriend is the one hurting me she is very wrong, I love her very dearly but now the only one causing me pain when I’m already feeling helpless is her. The other day she even ran away from my house for a straight two hours making me worry, and when she came back she threatened me and my 14 year old sister saying she was going to leave us because she’s tired of living in this stupid country with two daughters who are a disappointment who use her and don’t appreciate her (AND THAT IS NOT TRUE)","('blame', 'she', 'me')",blame,1,Interpersonal Beliefs / Emotions,Mind Reading,

She lost her job because of an ex-boyfriend she went back with, they broke up I don’t know how many times, she stopped seeing him finally a few months ago but she was also seeing another ex-boyfriend, both CHOSE to leave her without saying anything in the past which is why they broke up. She’s been on and off with this second guy. She’s been making progress in putting her life back together by going back to school but this guy is getting in the way. She told him to leave –he comes back and this repeats. A few days she went back to him after telling him to leave her alone once more because he was always at her place keeping her from her school work. I’m getting mad, because I don’t know how many times I spent the night consoling her because of these guys. Now she went back to him and it’s gonna be the same thing and don’t know what to say to her. I don’t agree with the relationship, her friends have told me the same also, but I don’t want to upset her. I’ve had enough of this back and forth. Every time she ends it he keeps going to her place, bangs on her door demanding to talk to her and she eventually caves. She told him to leave again and he told her to kill herself and said her kids don’t like her. Days later he demands to see her, she caves and the cycle repeats. I’m disappointed in her because the last time I spoke to her she hasn’t been to class and told me hasn’t done homework in a week because he’s there. Some of her friends have told me they’ve given up on her. I don’t want to do that but I’m close. We haven’t spoken since they got back together, one I don’t know what to say, two I feel like he’s controlling her. I want to be there for her but it’s just gonna be the same thing over and over.

But our family dynamics were already weird he moved when I was 3 so never really had a relationship anyway. It really hit my mum I guess as her parents had both died within the last year and she took it hard and i feel like she got quite sad. It was already tense that he didn’t want to go to the funeral, due to different religions. Then she found out about a month after her dad died that he was cheating. I was the one that discovered it by text anyway and I told her. Everything’s been a mess now and she’s changed so much. We used to be relatively close and in the first few months she was just always angry at me or crying because of him and since my brothers went to university it’s just been me and her. It feels like she’s so codependent on me and I can’t turn her away cause she’s my mum and that’s not me but it’s hard because I can barely deal with my own problems (depression). Now although it’s been a few months it just feels horrible all she’ll talk about is that other woman, whom she just follows around on social media and my dad. Everyone’s told her to just leave him but she won’t say that people told her it’ll affect us, but it really won’t it’d just be better really. She doesn’t think about what I want anymore just what she thinks or people tell her. She’s always on the phone to other people, got a massive extended family and it’s too the point where I’m just ignored and neglected, despite me making time for her. I feel like she doesn’t even love me anymore. Sometimes she’s say sorry so she knows she ignores me. It’s hard it’s my gcse year and this mess has just made my already bad mental health worse. I feel bad because life’s been hard for her since she’s essentially got with him, she got ill after pregnancy and poor financial decisions have moved her from the middle class to poor.

However, I don’t think I would ever do anything to hurt anyone, to be honest, I think 1) out of laziness and 2) I would want to be 100% sure I would get away with it. I’m an INTJ personality so I am meticulously organized and analytical. I have recently been very withdrawn socially and realized my relationships with people/conversations are quite superficial and I do it just because I sometimes need friends. However, while I feel like I can switch my empathy ‘off’ (stop caring), I do care very deeply for some people, and I love helping my loved ones and making their lives better. So I don’t understand why I can be a caring person as well as regularly lack empathy / feel superficially charming and manipulative and have fantasies are urges to hurt people? I’ve taken the Hare psychopathy checklist and scored 29, but like I said I can feel empathy when I want to, so I’m not sure that’s really accurate. Please let me know what you think and any advice (I know this isn’t clinical advice and I don’t think I need professional help, its not THAT bad). But still, appreciate any thoughts.

1436,3898,"From the U.S.:  My husband started to work from home like a year ago, it was just a part-time job and not very consistent.It worked well at the beginning but slowly started to be an issue in our relationship. I work full-time and I guess I started to be jealous of his schedule, being able to be home, etc. Since he had so much time, he started to play computer games again (used to play them 24/7 as a teenager) which also included joining some online forums. In July I discovered that he was talking to multiple girls online (sexually and romantically) and that he joined forums such “looking for relationship” etc. He told me he had only talked to one girl (I saw conversations with multiple women) and only because she had mental issues. After that, he stopped talking to them online, yet still kept playing video games. He was supposed to find a new job since his PT job slowly stopped making him any money, yet he wasn’t able to (or didn’t even try) find one within the past 6-7months. He plays his computer games around 10 hours a day, goes to bed at 3-5am pretty much every day, spends money (that I’m trying to save) on his games and ignores everything around the house. Whenever I try to confront him about something he gets very upset, calls me names like “b*tch” “idiot” and just yells at me. Whenever I find out he lied to me about something it’s the same – starts to yell at me, starts to throw things, hit himself, calls me names and sometimes blames it on me. Then he always apologizes and tells me how much he loves me and that I’m his everything. Now he is supposed to go back to school starting in two weeks, but every time I asked him to show me his log in, schedule or just something, he gets upset and his log in magically doesn’t work.I looked at his school email and saw many emails from his school counselors telling him that he was late to sign up and can only sign up for summer semester at this point. He also lied to them why he dropped out of school a year ago and said it was because of his dad’s illness (even though his dad is perfectly fine).I don’t have anyone to talk to since I moved from a different country to be with him.","('love', 'he', 'me')",love,1,Interpersonal Beliefs / Emotions,No Distortion,

1440,3900,"Hello, just to give some background, I’ve self-harmed and have gone to the hospital because of my injuries before. Ever since I was very young I’ve had strong urges to harm living things and even myself. I seem to like all things involving pain harm and blood. I’ve harmed myself several times in the past but not usually for suicidal tendencies but for fun, I try my best not to anymore. The thing that also concerns me is the fact I have terrible nightmares and very long and strange dreams/nightmares often having me hallucinate even after I wake up from the dream in the middle of the night. That has caused me to dread night time and being alone at home and the darkness (I sleep with a lamp on because of this). I’m often paranoid but I love to watch all things horror and dark so that doesn’t really help my situation either but I can’t seem to stop. I am always paranoids at night and feel as if something is out to get me and that would cause me to stare at something like the door or the mirror because I find it bad and I’d have a hard time falling asleep because of it sometimes as well.","('help', 'that', 'situation')",help,0,Supportive Actions,Emotional Reasoning,
1441,3901,"My sister is 33, married and has a 7, 4yr old and an 8th month-old recently diagnosed with a rare genetic condition. She has struggled with anger issue always but never acknowledges it. She always has dealt with stress or being mad at one person by shutting off and being angry with everyone. We as a family have just adapted to tip-toeing around her when she’s having a mood but has never addressed it properly by she will not talk about it and will stop speaking to you until you drop it. She is in a particularly bad episode at the moment and she is understandably stressed about her son’s condition and medical issues. She is angry at all of us and always pretty abrupt with the other children. Time has come to get her to acknowledge and cope with the way she deals with stress. She might need therapy but I don’t think shed even listen to this suggestion. How can we help her, giving her space but we don’t want her isolated ( she doesn’t have relationships outside the family), confronting her will push her farther away, talking to her won’t work she will just refuse to listen and we can’t keep ignoring it.

1458,3912,"Hello. I’ve been in a relationship for over a year now. We were friends for 2 years before that. When we were 4-5 months he said he had to tell me something important. He said that he was concerned about me and that I should take care of myself more because I always left me last. It hurt me so much (because I’ve had low self-esteem for a while and been insecure) that I got mad at him that day. After days our relationship changed a bit. I couldn’t put my finger on what was wrong. We felt a bit disconnected and awkward with each other and it hurt for both of us. Then my insecurities and anxiety got worse and worse. I accused him of cheating a few times and I was totally convinced that he was cheating. I felt betrayed, lonely, boring and flat to him. I started to feel like I didn’t love him, but I knew I did. I also lost trust on everything. I questioned our relationship everyday and it gave me anxiety. I was to nervous to see him or talk to him. I hated it.","('hate', 'I', 'it')",hate,1,Interpersonal Beliefs / Emotions,Labeling,Mental filter
1459,3915,"My boyfriend and I just moved in together. Since we’ve moved in together, he’s been getting angry with me every day. It usually revolves around me being too quiet. The first time we were in the car and he started yelling at me for being too quiet, I then got even more quiet as I’ve been in an emotionally and physically abusive relationship before (and that used to be the safest reaction) and then he started calling me names. I then had a panic attack, as I suffer from anxiety. Prior to meeting him, I hadn’t had an attack for a year. He always calls me names when he’s angry, and then when he’s calmed down he apologizes and says he’s sorry he’s been a dick, but he loves me, and I just need to give him time to get used to me. I’m starting to think that there’s something wrong with me and it’s my fault that he’s angry at me all the time. I’m walking on egg shells in our home and dread having days off work because he works 4am-11am so is home most of the day. He told me that he was sexually abused when he was younger, and I know that he has a “fuck everyone else” mindset, but he’d never been that way with me. I start shaking every time he yells at me now. If I try to talk to him about it reasonably, he gets even angrier and says I’m trying to blame him for everything when I’m clearly in the wrong. The worst part is that I’m a Detective and have worked in the domestic violence unit before and I should be able to recognize whether or not this is going where I think and feel it might be, but I can’t. I’ve never called him names, and have asked him to try not to do it when he’s mad, but he hasn’t stopped. He even says things like it’s no surprise I was single when he met me, I’m lucky because there are men out there that would be worse, etc. I don’t know what to do, or if it will get better.

1460,3917,"My bf and I reconnected online after 20 years. Within a year, I was divorced and he had moved 1000 miles to be with me. We moved in together right away and my 3 kids live with us part-time. My bf changed his whole life to be with me, left his marriage and job, all his friends, and moved here and started a new career. The problem is it has now been over 3 years and he has not gotten divorced. He avoided his wife for over a year when she tried to start the divorce process and then she got cancer and stopped pursuing him for a divorce. He doesn’t have contact with her but he gets updates on her health from his mother, who still keeps in touch with her. We have lived together for over 2.5 years now and have gone many places and always take photos wherever we go. His public-facing social media profiles are pictures from when he was with his wife. And he has changed the pictures since he moved in with me, but still changed them to old pictures from his life with her. He has one small item of hers that holds a lot of sentimental value that she has asked him to return to her by mail and he told her he would but still hasn’t done so. He sees the item all the time and knows she wants it back but still doesn’t mail it to her. It feels like he’s fighting as hard as he can to avoid letting go completely.

1462,3920,"Hi, i experience a problem that makes it very uncomfortable to be near other people. I will be sitting in a quiet environment and a thought will start popping into my head that i believe is wrong and humiliating. It tends to feel very loud and insistent and i have absolutely no control over it. And its the opposite of what i believe. For ages i will be terrified that im saying it out loud, even to the point where i try to hold my breath to stop it. I used to run away when it happened but now i can ride it out, even though its excrutiating and my face is glowing like a beacon. Horrible. I would be really grateful if you could explain whats happening and how i might get some help with it.

He has told me that he has a past incident with his younger sister and molested her when they were younger but that he has got help for it and was in a youth program until he became an adult.

He currently travels for work to another state Monday-Thursday every week. I am his first serious girlfriend and the only girlfriend he’s introduced to his parents (that don’t even live in the same state as we do). Throughout our 6-month relationship he has taken many steps to show how committed he is to me. For example, when I had received an interview for school in Colorado, he began interviewing for jobs there. For the past couple months, he’s been looking for jobs back in the city that we live in. Despite all the great things he’s done, and despite how much I know he loves me, I have severe trust/jealously issues. My last boyfriend had lied to me and was dating a “friend” while he was dating me. My first love whom I dated for 2.5 years broke up with me because he developed feelings for someone else. Needless to say, I let past experiences and my insecurities get the best of me in my current relationship. I have gotten jealous about his female friends and have admittedly over-reacted many times. However, I have had (what I fear) legitimate reasons to be concerned about his new friendship with a female coworker. Like I said he works out of state during the week. On the phone one night, he mentioned he met a girl at work who’s parents live where his parents live and that she invited him to get together for drinks with her and her brother during Christmas. Fast forward to Christmas, after not responding to my text for hours, he tells me he and his sister were having drinks and playing games at his coworker’s parents house.

1476,3929,"I have been dating a guy for the past 6 months. We met online and both live very busy lives where our careers are very important to us. He currently travels for work to another state Monday-Thursday every week. I am his first serious girlfriend and the only girlfriend he’s introduced to his parents (that don’t even live in the same state as we do). Throughout our 6-month relationship he has taken many steps to show how committed he is to me. For example, when I had received an interview for school in Colorado, he began interviewing for jobs there. For the past couple months, he’s been looking for jobs back in the city that we live in. Despite all the great things he’s done, and despite how much I know he loves me, I have severe trust/jealously issues. My last boyfriend had lied to me and was dating a “friend” while he was dating me. My first love whom I dated for 2.5 years broke up with me because he developed feelings for someone else. Needless to say, I let past experiences and my insecurities get the best of me in my current relationship. I have gotten jealous about his female friends and have admittedly over-reacted many times. However, I have had (what I fear) legitimate reasons to be concerned about his new friendship with a female coworker. Like I said he works out of state during the week. On the phone one night, he mentioned he met a girl at work who’s parents live where his parents live and that she invited him to get together for drinks with her and her brother during Christmas. Fast forward to Christmas, after not responding to my text for hours, he tells me he and his sister were having drinks and playing games at his coworker’s parents house. I got very upset and asked if they had hung out before. He admitted that they spent two hours together ALONE on the beach two days prior. I was distraught and did not speak to him until the next day.

1482,3931,"I have this issue since I was 9yrs old. When I was 9, I JUST used to make these characters in my head whenever i heard music and then make up a whole story in my head with music in the background. The music just had to be related to a story for e.g a story about a powerful queen story then the song “That’s my girl” But I used to this only when I heard the music. I didn’t do them by purpose. But when I turned 13, I started to “act them out” as well. I used to do this a lot more than before (I’d spent hours). I turned on music by purpose and then do it and I still do it now. I get inspired to do these stories when I see a movie or read another story. And I THINK music isn’t the main cause of this….it happens even without music. I hate it because it wastes my time and stops me from studying. I can only control not to do this for only 1 day and then I start to do it again. My question: Can I stop this? If yes, then how? if no, then how can I at least reduce it up to just 2 hours? Is music the cause or is it natural?

My mind never seems to drift away from over-analyzing any small part of my day that may be related to some sort of symptom of a disorder (such as overreacting to any thoughts that don’t seem to be mine kind of thing). I have already researched different disorders out of curiosity and know about different symptoms, I don’t believe I am a hypochondriac. I am currently seeing someone about a possible Anxiety Disorder and I believe I am showing some early symptoms of a Dissociative Disorder and some form of Psychosis, but I can’t help but worry about NOT being diagnosed with a disorder. Most nights I have imagined myself in a mental hospital when I am older or developing some sort of alternate personalities, the idea of someone experiencing these fascinate me, one recent dream of mine I remember was the exact life of me living with DID but I can’t remember it exactly.

When I was younger I used to get flashbacks of sexual things I was involved in that included another young girl that was around the same age as me.

In one of my flashbacks, I remember getting caught but now whenever the person that participated in the sexual acts gets mentioned, the activities in my flashbacks never get mentioned. I don’t know whether they don’t want to say or that it never happened and it’s just my mind making it up. Growing up, I began to settle with the thought that I was making it up in my head but then around 13/14 I began to remember specifics like how the other person said things like you were born a boy, your just born in the wrong body’ or incidents I woke up in a bed with a naked man. At this time I began questioning if the person I thought I was doing these things with wasn’t even a little girl but an adult man.

My father came to collect me and I got told off as he did not believe it was my mother who told me to do this and I suppose that had a lasting impact as since then I don’t believe he trusts me as an innocent party.","('trust', 'he', 'party')",trust,0,Supportive Actions,Mind Reading,Overgeneralization
1502,3956,"My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 4 years now. After a year of me commuting to see him (he lived 2 hrs away), we purchased a house together in his area and I began working from home. This is when I started to see issues. He would drink heavily every Friday & Saturday which wasn’t different from before but now he was showing his true colors. If he got angry or upset about something, he would take it out on me. He’s threatened to kill himself numerous times and has held loaded guns to his head while screaming at me. He’s even fired off a pistol into the ground right next to me while yelling. Another night, we both were drinking and went to bed late. I woke during the night and ran to the bathroom to vomit. He was angry that he had to come check on me and started to say nasty things. I began yelling at him asking what’s wrong with him and banged my hands onto his chest as I did that. Well, he hauled off and punched me in the fa ce. I never reported this to the police. He’s called me pathetic, said he has no respect for me and many other nasty things. This past May, he put a gun to his head again and that was it for me. I moved back to my town with plans of either selling the home we purchased together or him refinancing to have me removed. He still wouldn’t let me go and I allowed it for some reason!!! We’ve been seeing each other every other weekend since July (again, I’m doing all the driving). He has been doing much better with not drinking but I have caught him lying about it because I can tell when he is. In November, he decided to get drunk again and we had another nasty fight. He apologized saying he would never do it again, that he does not like the person he becomes when he’s drinking and that I should be treated like a queen. So, I gave him yet another chance. This past weekend, I asked if he got beer jokingly and he responded that he did but only a six pack. SMH! He then proceeded to tell me that he wanted to reach out to friends he cut ties with and when I asked if that was a good idea because they like to party, he got enraged! Called me all kinds of nasty things and was extremely hurtful. I told him I cannot do this anymore, that I deserve better and that he really needs to seek help from all the pain he has from childhood. He says he’ll NEVER go to therapy and that I need help because my emotions are out of control. He’s says I’m throwing away 4 years all because of a little argument. Why do I have such a hard time leaving this horribly abusive relationship????

1514,3960,I’m 23 years old and I live with my parents. I keep lying to them about college. I want to major in dietetics but I keep having problems with chemistry and I need it to actually claim dietetics as my major and I’m taking the needed nutrition courses for it in the meantime. The problem though is that I need an internship for dietetics to gain experience and I can’t qualify for one until chemistry is passed. I keep lying to my parents about my graduation date. It happens without me even thinking about it! The lies just come out. Sometimes I just want to disappear and my self-esteem and confidence are at an all-time low. I feel pathetic because I’m also jealous of my 19-year-old cousin and 14-year-old brother. They know what they want to do with themselves and it took me this long to figure out what I want to do. My brother is seeing a therapist for his issues and I don’t want to add to the problems. I love my family too much to want to hurt them but every time my doubts pop into my head they sound like my entire family berating me and tearing me down even though I know they wouldn’t do that. I feel like I’m going to drive myself crazy! Disappointing them is my worst fear and I hate when I feel like I’ve done that. The year before that I had admitted to them I was lying about doing well in school and now I’ve lied to them again. I’m sorry I just needed to vent. I’d usually talk to my uncle about this but I thought I was already past all of this shit. My parents deserve a better daughter.

I learned in psychology that one can learn aggressive behaviors from an adult when young.

Can she be fully conscious that their actions are wrong, knowing she understands right from wrong fully, and be able to change her behavior?

I then did a sleep study and was diagnosed with idiopathic hypersomnia. I was put on modafinil and it helped a little bit but eventually wore off and now I’m on armodafinil which has even less of an effect than modafinil did. The doc also prescribed Lexapro (which i’ve been on before) with the armodafinil and this time around it made me feel kind of depressed. The doctor took me off of it (this is a sleep doctor by the way) and explained that since I had a bad reaction to the Lexapro that i may have Bi-polar Depression. I don’t fit the signs of this but upon trying to relate to this condition I stumbled upon ADHD symptoms, how it is confused with depression, and how it can go undetected. The symptoms of ADHD fit me like a glove. I am forgetful, I lose things to an extreme that it disrupts my life. I have had anxiety since I was a child, I’m restless, impulsive, impatient, I have very bad fidgeting and nail-biting habits, I zone out on conversations, I have had drug and alcohol addictions in the past, I drink coffee all day and all night long, and my husband is put through hell trying to keep up with and clean up my messes, I even have to keep my cards and ID in his wallet so that I don’t lose them.

After therapy for all four family members the courts decided to give parents 50/50 custody. Thinking back now my mother’s behavior probably started at least a year or so before but it was at this time that I recognized my mother was often saying things like “did you sleep in your father’s bed when you were there” or “you know you shouldn’t be naked in front of your dad”. I want to make it clear that nothing like this was happening. My father has always been amazing and never acted inappropriately at all.

I told her that I was going with a couple of guys she knew. She called while I was driving and I had to admit I was with the female. She said that’s it; she’s done. I’m so guilty and heartbroken. She’s my whole world and she is the only person always there for me. But I keep treating her badly. Over Christmas I took several hundred dollars from her bank account to buy Christmas gifts. I told her I had something nice planned for her and her daughter. I spent all that money on drugs in one day! Then I lied and told her I didn’t it on an exirnduve gift for my mother. Of course, she caught me in that lie! You name it and I’ve done it to this woman. She deserves none of it! I want to be with her but I can’t keep myself in check. No insurance and can’t find a free clinic. I’m feeling worthless and guilty. I love her so much. But my lying and bad behavior carries on beyond just her. How can I find help? How can I keep her in my life? I’m losing all hope of a normal life and relationship.","('love', 'I', 'her')",love,1,Interpersonal Beliefs / Emotions,Fortune-telling,Labeling
1578,4034,"I find myself increasingly disillusioned with society and with my peers. In my classes, I feel like there is a lack of focus on important issues and my attempts to provoke conversations on current affairs in the world and how they should be dealt with, specifically in terms of race, domestic policy, and global issues. I feel as if moving on to higher education will not be worth it. I feel if I were to apply myself to some field and envelop myself in my work that it would allow free-loaders to succeed and ride my coattails. I feel as if my peers are rats who lie about their feelings and their interests. They’ll argue that they care very much for social issues such as global minorities facing persecution (the Rohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar, the Sudanese) yet they never say anything about these issues unless prompted by me. Furthermore, those conversations are one-sided and ephemeral because they quickly grow bored discussing issues they don’t care about.

1580,4038,"I’ve noticed for the past 2 years, I will have “mood swings”. One minute I’m so excited to visit my parents who live a few hours away…but a couple hours after I arrive, I notice that I go from being happy to shut down. I don’t want to talk about anything. I don’t want to be bothered. I’ve noticed this issue w, my boyfriend of 4 years, as well. We will be perfectly happy for a month straight and one day I just am so bothered by him though he hasn’t done anything wrong. It’s been happening often lately. I’m not sure if this has anything to do with but in high school I weighed 140ish… after high school I started dating my current boyfriend and I gained almost 60 lbs. since the weight gain, I don’t go out. I haven’t spent time with friends in over a year because I am embarrassed and insecure. I’m not sure if maybe I’m taking my insecurities and frustration out on others. I just don’t know what to do anymore. When I feel annoyed or frustrated, I know in my head that it’s wrong and I shouldn’t be rude or distant but my body won’t listen. Its like I have no control. I noticed my reactions have pushed my boyfriend away to thinking he did something wrong. I tell him over and over again that it’s not him… but then he tries to be affectionate or make me laugh and I shut down. I don’t want to be affectionate unless it’s on my time. I don’t understand it. I’ve tried to talk to my doctor about this but all they have done is prescribe depression medication. She didn’t really listen. Please help.

Now my problem is that I keep getting these episodes where I all of a sudden start not making sense and saying things like how can I walk to the sun or why is the lady stomping on ants like that when it was just a video of someone dancing. and i start like jumping around .yesterday i even sat in the fridge and started making strange sounds like an animal.I also will repeat the words shut up in a different voice.Its like this big rush I cant describe it.I sometimes get paranoid im being watched like through the computer screen or I CAN call some magical numbers in a foreign country. I make a pretty blank expression on my face. one common thread is i will always stare in the mirror and begin giving this weird creepy smile. another example was this photo of some dead guy that I laughed at for ten minutes straight and i was callin g him a loser.Sometimes i see things moving at the corner of my eye and hear my name being called.what the fuck is this.Can you guys just give a guess to what it could be. I dont think its just anxiety tbh.I dont feel anxious for the most part.I also notice I pace around a lot and many people sometimes find what i say bizzare at times. I dont think the therapist or psychologist will take this seriously anyway. one time i even was sitting on the couch and started thinking someone from across the street had a sniper so i closed the curtains. Im so worn out i feel embarressed. I know my behaviour is somewhat bizarre but i cant control it tbh and in the moment of being paranoid about those things i truly believe those strange thoughts.To me at times they seem vary real. like yesterday for example I felt like I was being taken over my mind and then it happened,the bizarre behavior started up.","('believe', 'i', 'thoughts')",believe,1,Interpersonal Beliefs / Emotions,Mind Reading,Magnification

At first, this feeling was enjoyable and entertaining; I loved the thought that my favourite celebrities were watching my every move and adoring me. But as I got older, this feeling became less enjoyable, and much more distressing. I removed all posters, covered up DVD cases, drew over the eyes on books. I am now 27 and still feel as though people in photos are watching me. It is only certain celebrities, never people I know personally. I was diagnosed with social anxiety in my late teens.

I began to worry even more and he suggested we leave his place.. it was 2am. While we were in the car, he began to suspect I was hiding something from him. He kept saying “What’s going on” and began interrogating me and went through my phone again believing I was out to set him up. I was afraid for my safety and I told him to get out of my car, he got a lyft and just left. I have not heard from him since and I am still worried about his mental state. What should I do?

1600,4060,"Ever since I was a child (7 to 10 years)I would feel aroused when I see someone humiliated or slightly tortured, I would imagine myself being the one receiving getting humiliated. I began masturbating when I was about 10, I didn’t even know what was I doing, I didn’t even know anything about sex or had any sexual feelings. I would lay on my stomach and just sort of pressure myself against the floor and I would never use my hands or finger myself, it has been the same way ever since. I am 20 years old, and I never get turned on by anything rather than humiliation and torture such as whipping and stuff. I learned that it’s a sexual masochism disorder. However, this whole issue has been bothering me for so long, and I cannot just get convinced that I was born this way. The fact that I only feel aroused this way ever since I was a kid makes me mad, especially because it’s not even associated with sex. It’s not like imagining having sex in that kind of way, sex is never even a factor in this. Never. Sex and steamy scenes never make me feel anything. I even began thinking that maybe I was sexually assaulted or abused in general as a child. My parents were normal and good, though. But for example, as a child and a teenager and even now, I am depressed most of the time. I am also very reckless towards myself like in fifth grade I swallowed so many pills to die and it was for a stupid reason. I used to self-harm very deeply( not related to masochism), and there is so much other stuff. Lately, I have been trying to remember my childhood. We had a nanny for a few years when I was 6 or 7, I remember that I hated her so much, that I once held a knife and told her that I would kill myself if she didn’t stop bothering me. I don’t remember though what she used to do, I cannot even remember her face which is weird because I remember people and stuff from a stage much earlier than that in my life. I have also been bullied as a kid from my friends but not like physically or anything. I know it’s stupid but I desperately want an explanation.

About a year ago his friend stayed over at our house while we were out on vacation, I’ve never met his friend before and only said yes because he said his friend was trustworthy. His friend ended up bringing over a female coworker and not letting us know but I found an eyeliner so I was upset and asked my boyfriend to talk to him since he didn’t want me to talk to his friend myself. Fast forward to last night his friend (the same one) called me my boyfriends ex-girlfriends name. Keep in mind this guy has been at my house and my boyfriend and I have been together for 4 years. I got upset and ended up leaving early because I was so mad and didn’t want to make a scene with someone I barely knew. Before I left I told my boyfriend he needed to talk to him because his friend disrespected me and made me wonder why he would call me someone’s name who was in my boyfriend’s life over 4 years ago. He said he talked to him and told him to apologize to me so his friend tried to add me on Instagram to apologize. I want nothing to do with his friend and I’m upset that all my boyfriend did was have a talk with his friend that I made him have and then went on to act like nothing happened. Now we’re arguing because I’m afraid my boyfriend doesn’t respect me since he did absolutely nothing except what I asked him to do. I feel like I shouldn’t have to deal with after being with him for 4 years, we also just bought a house together 3 months ago.

He was even placed on academic probation for several months. When he went back, he did OK for one quarter and the back to the same problems. Each time, he seems to escape into video games, binge-watching TV serials, etc. We believe there is no reason to suspect substance abuse. He constantly lies about the status of his course work and then gets caught out in stupid ways when he ends up confessing. His friends love him and think highly of him but he avoids building strong relationships. There are probably only 1 or 2 friends he is in touch with regularly.

1630,4096,Me and my girlfriend have been dating for 5 months. She has been part of a Baptist chruch for 5 years now. But she is also bisexual which is a sin. Also another problem with her is her past and how insecure she is. Before she meet me she been with a few girls and they cheated on her so she basically shut down and locked herself from everyone else. Basically she is using religion to help her move forward in life and recover and become a better person. But people don’t realize that religion isn’t what fixes you it’s the people on the chruch with you. She feels like she owes her whole heart to Jesus because she believes that Jesus has been her savior. But along it has been people in the church. Because of the religion she is saying she is waiting until marriage for sex. But I believe she is using it to cover up herself because she so insecure about herself. Like trust me she I would say why but I only got400 words. Deep down inside she wants to do these things but she scared that if I see her naked or something that I will run away. We’re both overweight alot but nothing over 300 pounds.

1633,4097,"From a young man in the U.S.: I wanted to understand the link between the upbringing of one , past experiences ,and past ideologies and how much it can affect ones current reasoning. Does a person have utter and complete freedom to change his reality or would there always be a faction of his brain leading him to a biased conclusion because of his past experience. For example can a person fully understand and change his reality without his brain affecting that decision based on his past. In other words , a person who grew up in a religion , and changes his religion, can he or she be able to fully accept a new belief and formulate a new truth based ok current thinking and not be influenced by the past. In other words how much control do humans have to truly shape their reality based on their logic and not be biased based on any past experiences or at least not make a decison base on that fully.","('understand', 'person', 'example')",understand,0,Supportive Actions,No Distortion,
1634,4098,"My loved one and her boyfriend have been together since high school. She is in her mid-twenties now and they just had a baby girl. He has tried to leave her multiple times throughout their relationship, but she would threaten suicide in order to keep him around. A little bit about her: she suffers from childhood trauma. She had a very rough life growing up before she was adopted into my family. There is a history of schizophrenia, depression, and autism in her biological family tree. She is unreliable when it comes to committing to plans. She used to sleep all day, before the baby. She is never happy and if you make any mistakes, she will hold a grudge forever. She expects perfection from others, but will have excuses for herself. Since the age of twelve she has always had a boyfriend, I think her greatest fear is being single or alone. She is always angry or upset with him but will not let him go. A little bit about him: he is 3 years younger than her, he wants to be a twenty-something year old and hates being restricted by her. He has ADHD and chronic migraines, as well as a dysfunctional family. He has gotten to the point where he tries to reach out to other girls, or he tries to escape with friends. She goes through his phone every day AND SEES THAT HE IS TRYING TO CHEAT ON HER but will still not let him go. He has stopped doing household chores, he no longer helps take care of their child, he is trying to escape. If he is ever alone with the baby he tries to get others to watch her for him. He is always reaching out to me telling me how he does not love her, and how he wants to leave. I do not respond, but I predict that if he manages to leave, she will follow him. Or he is just venting to me and actually will not try to leave (because he’s done that before). They are currently looking for a new place to move in to. I do not want to risk reaching out to him due to his phone getting checked everyday, but I do not think my loved one will listen to any advice I give her, because she is not looking for it.

I don’t enjoy my job, I have close to zero friends ever since I quit drinking and drugs, I’m always worrying about things that don’t even matter, I still think about the girl who broke my heart over ten years ago, My brother (who I love very much) lives on the other side of the country, I don’t know where to meet a decent girl that I could start a family with, I don’t have the spark or motivation to hold conversations with people, I have very little interest in many of the things I used to enjoy doing, and frankly, I’m afraid that I’m going to die alone without a family. These are just a few things I’m struggling with. On the flip side, I have a very good life (on paper). I have a mom and dad who love me and care about me, i have a roof over my head, food in the fridge, and water in the sink. Most people would say I have nothing to complain about which is probably true. So I’m just wondering, why do I feel so hopeless for the future? I try very hard to be positive but I’m constantly waking up in a foul mood wishing I was still in dreamland. I’m very quiet at work because I simply don’t have the energy to engage in conversation. People probably think that I don’t like them or that I’m better than everyone else, but the truth is, I just don’t have the ambition to talk with people like I did when I was younger.

1652,4111,"Adult son 23 has been depressed for years. Not moving forward with his life. My husband and I took a NAMI class (12 weeks) and am starting to understand that he may be bipolar ll. He refuses help from psychologists or psychiatrists. Doesn’t feel they can help. Feels that the US is caught up in political wrongdoings and it is going to wreck our world. Constantly checking phone to find out political happenings. Says he is a nihilist and no psychologist around our area can help him. What is the purpose of moving forward. He is living at home with his us (parents) and having a hard time. No friends around (all off to college), bored, sleeps alot, not working. Is going to try to take classes in Jan but this will be his 3rd attempt-first two he got too depressed to finish-even though he had good grades. He thinks school is his only hope. My question-how do you help someone with this mentality? I feel like there is no hope. He constantly does things to self-sabotage and is not helping himself. Just too depressed to help himself. Is there any online counseling? The problem is he is very smart and has been able to manipulate other counselors into thinking nothing is wrong-or he is pretty ok. Which isn’t the case. Any suggestions would be helpful. Thank you.","('help', 'you', 'someone')",help,0,Supportive Actions,Fortune-telling,Mental filter
1653,4112,"My son is 15 and a freshman in high school. He is very athletic and has wrestled since he was 5 years old. He is very talented and wrestles on the national level with a lot of success. However, he recently decided he doesn’t want to wrestle in high school. My husband and all the coaches want him to wrestle at least his first year in high school to see if he likes it. He says he wants to box instead. My husband and his coach said he will regret it if he doesn’t wrestle because he is so talented. I don’t know if I should force him to wrestle one year in high school and see how it is, then, if he doesn’t want to continue that’s fine. Practice is right after school and his older brother wrestled too so he doesn’t have a ride home unless I come to get him. My husband said I should just let him stay at school until wrestling is over and his brother can bring him after practice.

1656,4117,"I am 16 years old, 17 in 2019 and I have a very hard time in not losing interest in girls I’m with. so, for the past 3 years, I have had about 100 to 150 girlfriends and I’ve been talking to about 400-500. The problem is now I want to have a serious relationship, but after a couple of weeks ago by I start to lose interest in the girl. the girls are great, minor flaws, beautiful faces, great personalities etc. I feel attached to the girl but if I see another girl, I like I can’t keep myself from asking her number, messaging her etc. Also, a major thing I have noticed is that if I start to get sexual with the girl, I start to lose interest after we go home (when we’re no longer facing to face). This has been bugging me for about 7-8 months now and I’m really starting to feel bad emotionally and psychologically. Right now, I have a girlfriend who is an amazing person with a great personality and she is just amazing overall. Like most girls, I unintentionally get them to love me and right now she is attached to me. I have this feeling inside that I want to leave her like my heart feels weird. This always happens a week or two before I leave a girl. This time I don’t want to, I want to have a serious relationship. People are usually jealous that I have a multitude of girls wanting to be with me dating me etc. but it happens unintentionally and right now I just want to have 1 girl in my life. I sometimes cry about this because I don’t know what to do. Thank you in advance. (From Turkey)","('love', 'them', 'me')",love,1,Interpersonal Beliefs / Emotions,Emotional Reasoning,

It has been an intense 6 months and I am still struggling daily although I am trying my best to do the little things that help me to not be so obsessive over my worries. Recently, I have been worried about one day going insane and not being able to control it. I once watched a movie about a man who was able to time travel against his own will, everytime he woke up from his sleep. I know this is ridiculous but I actually thought what if that happens to me? And feared for a couple days straight. I know this is impossible and now that I look back on it, I realize that this is almost laughable. Although I no longer fear that I will be able to time travel, I’m afraid of the fact that I even feared such a ridiculous, impossible scenario. It triggered anxiety in me because I thought that I was going crazy. It was different from any other fear that I had because this was a fear that was sprouted from fiction while all of my other fears sprouted from things that happened in real life. (Ex. Cancer). I researched online and read that people who are crazy have a hard time differentiating reality from fiction. But during those two day of fear, it was almost as if It could happen to me (which I know that it couldn’t). Am I going crazy? I’m really afraid.

Also, he was adopted as a baby and recently found his biological family. That’s been very positive, but very emotional too. Lately, he’s been lashing out at me on a regular — almost nightly basis.

I made a bad decision just like im sure every teenager has done once in their life. I went to hang out with friends during the day without telling my parents when i moved 1000 ft away. instead of being grounded for a week or two i was told all of these horrible things such as your a failure, your a disappointment, your a whore, your a slut, no one likes you, your trash, you have no real friends, kill yourself.

About a month ago I started to feel a low mood coming on and I stopped taking my medication for a about a week.

Recently I have been starting to feel like I am coming down again, and I know that stopping the medication is definitely not a good idea but I find myself wanting to.

His behavior include emotional manipulation, intense reactions, exaggerations, and he has paranoia to a certain extent.He keeps calling my mother daily to see where she is, and secretly follows her to work most mornings. He demanded for all her passwords for social media, as well as her phone.When she comes home late from work, even for 5 minutes, he creates a scene and argues with her. He threatens that he will kill himself. When they argue, if to him it feels like the problem wont be resolved, to make amends, he threatens her. He threatens her with not drinking or eating, constantly drinks alcohol with his medication. He is also delusional in the fact that my mother is cheating on him, when this is not the case. He took extreme measures to grab her cell phone, download apps that can see all the text messages sent and received, and he also has a GPS on her constantly tracking her. At the same time, he sits in his office after work most of the day and listens to 5 hour voice recordings of some type of listening device he has in her work office, or here at home. It might even be somehow installed on her phone, he is constantly trying to find out a possible cheating going on, or even trying to look for lies in the voice recordings.

1693,4164,"Dear Therapist, I would like to have some advice. I’m only 15 years old and very mature for my age. but thats not what i need advice about. I’m too young to be worrying about my life the way I do. i have a very good body image and I try to keep it that way as best as i can. a little too much. I believe I suffer from Obsessive Compulsive Dissorder. I havent really been able to admit it to myself or anyone around me. I believe I’ve had it for maybe two years or so, but its gotten worse over time. It starts with waking up. If i dont sit up a certain way that doesnt make me comfortanle, I lay back down. I go down stairs to eat my breakfast. if i dont see something i like on TV i have to blink 10 times or until im confortable to get the image out of my mind. in school, i cant sit on chairs without whiping it off 5 times because if i dont, i think ill get fat. i can’t touch doorknobs because im afraid ill get sick from the germs. If i smell something bad, or something i dont like, i have to “push out” the bad scent out of my nose three times and breathe in “good smells” once or twice. My friends notice that I’ve been acting strange but i usually cover it up by saying like my nose itches or there were crumbs on the seat. Its really hard for me to live with and i am soo frustrated from it. Im only a sophmore in High School. I should be worrying about school. i strongly think my grades are suffering from it too. i Already see a therapist because my mom thinks im have anger problems. but i can never bring up the guts to tell her about my suffering. What im asking is to know that I’m not the only one whos going threw this or if I’ve diagnosed myself correctly. Ive researched it and all signs point to OCD. But i also am angry all the time towards my mother. she grosses me out but i cant control it. when im around her my ‘habits’ act up. but theyre more like natural reactions than habits. I dont know if medication will help with these problems or if i need sleep or if its stress. I really need some advice because i hate living like this. Am I going crazy? (life at home) My mom some times goes a little crazy or acts stranger than usual. she yells at me than apologizes. it gives me whipelash. i know she sees a therapist and i just hope that craziness isnt heretitary. can living with someone make you sick of them? even if their your own mother? and my father is an alcholic. but he has been 7 months sober. i am the middle child and i get along fine with my siblings. although my brother often gets annoyed with me because of my breathing habits. they annoy him. I also have severe headaches. Sometimes they give me excrutiating pains and sometimes they are dull. I also feel depressed and sad all the time. I try to act happy when im around my friends but i want to feel truely happy. Im usually in my room all day after school breathing in and out in certain ways, trying to reset the “bad germs” that i have breathed in. (im sorry if ive confused you). I had a concussion in the past but im not sure if ive fully healed, or its all in my head. i get weird head aches in the front of my mind when im doing my rituals and it throws off my day. sometimes i dont feel like im in my body/mind. i feel like im always tired and i feel like im always asleep. and i dont feel my emotions to the fullest. sometimes i dont feel any emotions. its hard to explain. but i just need some advice. Im handeling this all on my own and Im not sure WHAT to do. i keep a journal of everything that goes on and it makes me more depressed. im not sure if you know what im asking or not. but please help me if you can!","('help', 'medication', 'problems')",help,0,Supportive Actions,Should statements,Personalization

In the beginning I wasn’t really interested in him, I was a bit skeptic about him and as shallow as I can be I didn’t find him very handsome at first. It automatically put me in a more dominant position. I warned him I don’t feel the same like he feels for me but that we have fun together, we click and I enjoy spending time with him. He did most of the effort to be with me, I kept my mind open about him and our relationship developed to something deeper and now I love him and we make a great team.","('love', 'I', 'him')",love,1,Interpersonal Beliefs / Emotions,No Distortion,

1723,4197, I am a 35 year old woman and going through a depressing phase of my life. I have been married for over 10 years now and have two young sons. I have known my husband since our school days and we were good friends for about 4-5 years and then our friendship transitioned into a relationship from which he eventually backed out in fear of his mother. But eventually not any significant reasons known to me proposed me later for marriage for which I also agreed as I was in love with him. To me most probable reasons for him proposing me 1. he felt guilty towards me 2. He eventually thought me best suitable out of the proposals he received for marriage and as he knew that I loved him might have thought me to be submissive to him and follow him blindly for whatever he says.,"('marry', 'I', 'years')",marry,1,Interpersonal Beliefs / Emotions,Mind Reading,

My other friend tried to give her a session with our school’s counselor/psychiatrist but she continuously refused and told us that we didn’t understand’ and she was never going to tell anyone her problems’. Quick note: I used to have depression and was sent to a therapist to recover. I mentioned that I had been in her place and knew how she felt. She wouldn’t listen and threatened not being our friend if we didn’t cancel that session. I’m guessing that was because it was in the school and she didn’t want her bullies finding out.

But at the beginning of my sophomore year, we began to develop a relationship. Initially, we were just friends and I never really felt any kind of intimate feelings for him. As with any other attractive guy I’ve met, however, I was somewhat shy around him at first but started to feel more comfortable as I got to know him better. But still, we were strictly friends. It wasn’t until the summer between my sophomore and junior year that I realized that I had feelings for him. We spent a lot of time together, as we were both taking the same summer school class. During this summer, I found out a lot about him. I noticed that he didn’t speak about his dad a lot, if at all, and he liked to garden, cook, and was very meticulous about how he looked. I attributed these qualities to the possibility that he was a very proper gentleman, as he surprisingly turned out to be due to the fact that I used to hate him. One of my good female friends met him and immediately told me that he was gay. I disagreed with her. I had remembered him telling me about a girl he dated back in high school, so I assumed him to be straight. But then he had also mentioned that the reason why they broke up was because he told her that they got along better as friends. I’ve heard this excuse from other guys, so it didn’t hint to me that he was gay. During my junior year, he told my aforementioned female friend that he was gay, and she relayed the information to me. My first reaction was denial. I think that I had so severly developed feelings for him, almost on an unconscious level, that I couldn’t bear to believe that he was gay. Later that week though, he told me face-to-face. After that, our friendship didn’t fall apart and I wasn’t distressed. In fact, our friendship strengthened and for a while things were great. I have told him several times that I have feelings for him, and he just laughs it off.

He kept the pregnancy a secret from his family and friends for months and came clean with his mother, with whom he has a good relationship, when the little girl was 6months old.

I don’t want him to touch me. I don’t want him to breathe near me and if anything, he would be better off dead. No one cares. No one does or says anything that helps. I am so angry. I feel like I can’t talk, – there’s too much going on and I can’t explain everything because everything bothers me so much. He bothers me so much. He does things he shouldn’t be doing. Why can’t I get away with things he was told not to do – does them anyway and gets a free pass? I’m tired when people yell at me. Instead of telling me how to do things, what to wear, what to say, how to feel – actually help. No one recognizes their wrongdoing, it seems. I know I could be more positive and I have been – but now I can’t. I’m stuck with a friend which keeps trying to remind me why people act like what – INSTEAD of just listening. I didn’t say anything before because I feel so un-entitled to things. I know I can’t control. I’m so angry and tired of being reminded these things ALL the time – because I know. Constantly being reminded just makes me feel dumb and worthless and unlovable.

My husband is wonderful and very patient and we’ve worked through a lot of things over the years but lately I just get so tired, and frustrated, and I act out and just generally become disagreeable, angry and violent.

I never had the relationship with my father to tell him, even though in later years we grew a lot closer. I am not sure as what to tell my friend.

I first didn’t realize what he needed and he kept complaining and fighting for the past 2 years and I only understood and matured lately. I’ve been trying to give him what he needs for the past 2 months but he won’t open up. A few days ago, he admitted to me that he was emotionally cheating on me and that he just figured it out and he kept apologizing and crying, begging for my forgiveness and telling me he’d give me whatever I needed but that he didn’t want us to break up because he couldn’t bare losing me. He admitted he was totally wrong and that he had no excuses but the reason it happened was that he wasn’t getting what he needed from me and he swore he never went looking for his needs elsewhere and he kept pushing the girl away but he got weak after a while. My boyfriend has never been unfaithful and I know he loves me insanely, he’s just over friendly with girls and I honestly find it really difficult to deal with, because I’m very insecure, because I find his behavior exceeding “limits”, and especially that he wouldn’t accept me to behave this way around guys.","('love', 'he', 'me')",love,1,Interpersonal Beliefs / Emotions,No Distortion,
1836,4353,"Hello, I’ve been with my girlfriend for 7 years. I’m totally in love with her and I followed her to NY when she landed her dream job a couple of years ago. Recently, she was fired for reasons here undisclosed. Obviously this was a gigantic blow for both of us. Since then, she’s developed a series of behaviors that have led to me wanting to seek help here. In a nutshell, she has always been a sensitive and highly empathic person and she claims that she’s been given a new calling from a higher being. She spends her nights now looking across the street at one of our neighbors, like in a movie, and with a video game controller, she follows what he’s doing. She says that she is watching over him and that she will make his life better like this since he seems lonely to her. On top of this, she’s fasting; only eating fruits and nuts during a certain portion of the day. All of it seems super calculated and ritualized in great detail. I come from an extremely religious family so I’ve seen similar but never ever like this. And this doesn’t correspond to any popular religion. I’ll say that she has never exhibited behavior like this in all the time we’ve been together. I’m obviously extremely worried about her and on a selfish note, I miss her a lot because she doesn’t seem to need or want me anymore. The other thing is that she seems totally lucid when I speak with her, but what she does seems not right of course. She has not yet lost her temper with me or lashed out at me though even when I try to get her to stop. And another thing is that she’s extremely proud and distrustful of doctors so I’m afraid that if I try to get her to see one, she’ll break up with me. I’m wondering if I could get advice on what to do? Is it okay to start a correspondence with a doctor behind her back and try things out to see if she gets better? For example, since I’m a cook and she used to love my cooking, I’m going try to at least get her to eat by making some of her favorites. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

He fighted with weed dependence, he had obsessive compulsive thoughts because of drugs, anxiety…then a doctor recommended him Seroxat, he had a dependence for this medication too.

We have never had any issues and he has always treated my daughter as his own. I need some advice on what others would do? I want him in the delivery room when I go into labor but my family thinks it’s the wrong choice. He was arrested for unlawful eavesdropping and survalince. He was bonded out after 2 days. My parents think I am a bad parent for wanting him to be there knowing what he did. I need to know what others think because I love my kids and never want to lose them and at this time my parents are telling me they will take my kids. And they know I would never let that happen. I have always been controlled by my parents and they feel like their own opinion is the only and right one. Please help and give me your honest opinion. My dad feels like I need to talk to a therapist and this is a lot for a pregnant woman to handle without someone to talk to. I think my parents are taking it too far to say that since he did this he will mess with my kids. The camera was also never used and had to be used within my mom’s home so I don’t think he knew how it worked before putting it there.,"('love', 'I', 'kids')",love,1,Interpersonal Beliefs / Emotions,Mind Reading,Overgeneralization

Usually I spend a great majority of my free time in solitude, I don’t bother having social interactions with others (family or acquaintances) because quite frankly it is not enjoyable or particularly interesting. As far as intimacy goes I absolutely disdain love and affection. My childhood was great, and I do not have any family issues currently or from the past. I simply find that love and affection disgusts me. I realized that when I was 12, my mother would shower me with love and it would completely irritate me and grind my gears. She knows now that I do not like that so she stopped. The issue however, is my lack of any emotion and care for others. I am an introvert, but most introverts have some kind of social interactions with close friends or acquaintances. I however don’t have friends since most people cant meet my expectations and when I am friendly to someone they associate that with interest and they start to become annoying and wanting to have a conversation. I usually show them I am uninterested by replying with single words or expressing no emotion on my face until its awkward and they say goodbye. I cant connect with people at all on an emotional level is what I realized I don’t care about the persons dreams, desires, emotions or well-being for that matter. This may come across as very blunt and rude. But I don’t even care about my parents in the same manor I don’t care about other people. I don’t mind socializing so long as there is a clear goal (work or educational space). I don’t enjoy communicating with people for enjoyment.

Her boyfriend has never liked me. He never says anything positive. Sure what he says may be true but I think it’s not helping. Me and my mom fight a lot but what I’m concerned about is her mood changes when her boyfriend is around. Like today we had a great day. Lots of laughing. We had our friend over and we were all in the spa and my son was splashing and things were great. I leave to take my son to baseball practice and when I return she is in complete hate mode towards me. And when I left we just had a fun day and things were good. I ask what’s wrong and she tells me “oh you don’t give me attitude one day and we’re fine?” I’m curious if it’s bad that whenever she’s with her boyfriend in her room all the talk between them is him talking negatively about me. I’m wondering if that would stress our situation and not make it any better because he’s there fueling her brain and reminding her what a f*** up her daughter is.

He has a fear of being around people and hears voices, started neglecting personal hygiene, spends compulsively (ie. Bought 4 jackets exactly alike, 3 still in the package.) but does not have the budget for it. The real problem, every time he goes to get help they accuse him of just wanting to get drugs, but he hates taking any drugs. Also, doesn’t think he has a problem except the sleep issue. He keeps saying if he could just get sleep everything will be fine, even after a good night’s sleep. How do we convince health care providers there is a problem?

I can’t feel remorse or guilt for anything I do. I never feel REAL attachments. I may have developed these traits due to my rough childhood. My father was absent for the past 8 years. He used to call and ask for money, in which my mother made me pick up and relay her messages. I felt like a helpless puppet, and I was angry that they didn’t care how I felt. My father was manipulative and was in general an evil person. I’m not like him completely. As I said, I can’t feel bad for others. I’ve watched VERY graphic, violent videos and feel nothing. I even laugh at the way the victims die. I get annoyed by people who bother me. I feel like shoving a pen into their idiotic eyeballs. I am impulsive and cannot think ahead. I rarely experience fear, and never distress (except pain). I (willingly) think of horrible things happening to people I love, and I don’t care. I’m only nice to people for what they can offer me. I see my brother and his girlfriend express affection for each other, and I can’t understand love. I used to be a really nice, caring, understanding kid. Now I’m impatient and & rude. I keep up the sociopathic mask so I don’t seem insane. I have dead eyes, and often make people uncomfortable with my stare. I recently took interest in a girl, and I liked her. After enough time, I broke her and her boyfriend up. I manipulated her, while maintaining a friendly smile . It almost worked, but things went South and they got back together. This heartbreak made me block out emotions (sound familiar). I’m not seeking help, because tbh I like my mindset. But I just want to know once and for all if I’m a sociopath.

He used to call and ask for money, in which my mother made me pick up and relay her messages. I felt like a helpless puppet, and I was angry that they didn’t care how I felt. My father was manipulative and was in general an evil person. I’m not like him completely. As I said, I can’t feel bad for others. I’ve watched VERY graphic, violent videos and feel nothing. I even laugh at the way the victims die. I get annoyed by people who bother me. I feel like shoving a pen into their idiotic eyeballs. I am impulsive and cannot think ahead. I rarely experience fear, and never distress (except pain). I (willingly) think of horrible things happening to people I love, and I don’t care. I’m only nice to people for what they can offer me. I see my brother and his girlfriend express affection for each other, and I can’t understand love. I used to be a really nice, caring, understanding kid. Now I’m impatient and & rude. I keep up the sociopathic mask so I don’t seem insane. I have dead eyes, and often make people uncomfortable with my stare. I recently took interest in a girl, and I liked her. After enough time, I broke her and her boyfriend up. I manipulated her, while maintaining a friendly smile . It almost worked, but things went South and they got back together. This heartbreak made me block out emotions (sound familiar). I’m not seeking help, because tbh I like my mindset. But I just want to know once and for all if I’m a sociopath.

1946,4485,"I have Borderline Personality Disorder & Bipolar Disorder Type II, with transient psychotic episodes. I was prescribed a brand new anti-psychotic, Invega (3 mgs.) about two & a half weeks ago for: distorted thinking, amplified emotions, & daily crying spells. As opposed to the same class of more recent anti-psychotics, such as Seroquel, I am tolerating this one very well — with the exception of weight gain. I have been dieting & exercising in an effort to eliminate or decrease this side effect, but have still already gained 5 pounds! I’d like to know if this side effect will subside as my body gets acclimated to it, or with time. I discontinued the others because this is the one side effect which I will not withstand. I discontinued the others due to this reason. If the answer is no, then should I try the older anti-psychotics, such a Haldol? Do they cause weight gain, too? Will the other drugs help my symptoms? I’d appreciate your opinion. My psychiatrist says he isn’t sure about my concern, since the medication is so new.

While I started and developed the relationship with him because I was very lonely at the time, I developed feelings for him and to this date, he is my closest friend. The problem that I always had when I was with him was that I was never in love with him. Staying in the relationship felt very emotionally safe and I was happy being with him even though I never felt the “butterflies in the stomach” being with or thinking of him. He felt like a family and I did and still do care about him. And that was what I was looking for – the emotional comfort of having someone next to me who loves me and cares about me. The missing part in our relationship was the fact that I never felt romantically about him and so two years later, I started sleeping with another man B, which developed into a relationship. I feel in love with B but I have been comparing him with A and this of course has made me see more of his negatives. I am very attracted to him and like to spend time with him. However, when the time came to “go home”, i.e. do every day things, relax and stay home, I would always want to meet with A. A continues to feel like home, like the place where I go at the end of the day to be comfortable, share my day at work, watch TV, or just relax while being silent.","('love', 'who', 'me')",love,1,Interpersonal Beliefs / Emotions,No Distortion,
1962,4504,"Until a few months back I used to play GTAV at my friend’s house without my parent’s permission, this went on for three years and then I told them. They didn’t get that mad but told me I couldn’t play it anymore. The problem is that now that I never play it anymore I feel a very strong need to play it and since no other game can replace it I feel unhappy and unfulfilled. When I actually write it out the first time it sounds really pathetic but it’s actually quite a big problem. I wasn’t very happy with my life before but video games was an easy way to cope with other things (when I say cope I don’t mean through extreme violence like in GTA’s case, more like a person who really likes soccer and uses that). The reason my parents won’t let me play it is because of the mature content but I’m not interested in the sex and drugs and the violence is unrealistic enough not to affect me at all. To be honest I don’t really feel anything special when for example killing people in video games. I’ve done a lot of research and I like to think that I know more than most people about psychology and I’m very sure that I’m not a psychopath nor narcissist. An example from the game is this one scene involving torture which I found pretty hard to get through. I’m also quite intelligent for my age and has scored 121 on an IQ test, I’ve also got really good grades and stuff so I think that that’s maybe why I’m not affected by violence I know is fake. I’ve also already done pretty much everything in the game and seen almost everything in it in movies and tv series, so I kinda feel like I’ve seen everything and that all potential damage is already done. My parents have also said that you shouldn’t take chances and that I may get affected even though I didn’t before. That may be but I’ve actually begun to feel really depressed and sad most of the time and I know that there’s no other way to fix it.

1964,4505,"I don’t know how to deal with my sister anymore. She’s completely irrational and I’m worried that she might have some underlying mental problems. Whenever she has a problem she completely disregards any rational/reasonable help. If you cannot help her and release her of her problem immediately she will be extremely rude/vile to you. I have tried every approach. At the beginning I was angry, I yelled and yelled. When I realized that that wasn’t working I adopted a calmer approach. I do not yell anymore, but I do have to admit, I am extremely impatient. Every move I make is met with some sort of rude remark, even things as simple as standing behind her to read what she’s writing on the homework assignment that she asked me to help her with. I respond by asking her why she’s talking to me the way that she is, she responds with Ugh I don’t care just be quiet, if you’re not going to help me then leave. I don’t think that she understands how the way she talks to people effects their ability to help her in stressful situations. She doesn’t realize that I’m trying to help her, and that she is actually making it difficult. She also does not learn from her experiences. She has been yelled at, been talked calmly to, and has even been hit on multiple occasions. I don’t think that she realizes that what she does is wrong, because she does the exact same things that she is punished/scrutinized for over and over again. It’s an endless cycle.

1994,4549," My husband and I are both nurses. We have two sons. Our oldest will turn five in May and our second son will turn one in April. My husband works full time while I stay home with the kids. Tonight, I caught our 4-year-old wearing my thong underwear under his pajamas. It turns out, he stashed some of my underwear in his room along with two of my Victoria’s Secret catalogs. We talked to him about this. I have always noticed evidence of what Freud calls the oedipal complex in my son. He is a smart boy and has adapted quite well to his new role as big brother. He has said “why did God not make me into a girl” but when I explore this, it turns out that what he really means is that he likes girls, including mommy because girls are pretty. I have never seen any other “feminine” tendencies in him (he’ll say pink is for girls and refuse to ride a Barbie bike) but I just want to make sure that this is just a normal phase for him and we shouldn’t be thinking about gender issues here.

1995,4550,"Recently, i feel like i’m going mental. Guilt, depression, and all other negative emotions are what i’m feeling ! I keep doubting everyone around me, including myself, i feel like i might lose control. Sometimes i get awful thoughts that makes me feel guilty. sometimes i dont think my thoughts are mine at all. i even started wondering if this was reality, maybe the world doesn’t exist and that im dreaming. im paranoid about everything; people are staring, they’re talking behind my back, i cant trust anyone- my mood keeps changing, one times im cheerful and happy and the next im angry and depressed, the next im hateful and dislike everyone. then i began thinking that pain is nice and that it eases my guilt. i feel guilty a lot. i also think that someone is living inside my brain, watching me and judging me and it scares me a lot because i cant behave normally since i feel like the person inside my mind is laughing at me. im so so so so exhausted and all i want is rest but i cant seem to rest i love my family a lot, a lot, but because of my current mood swings and mental state ive been mean to them. it makes me guilty to the point i feel suicidal i dont know what i should do to cure myself.","('love', 'i', 'family')",love,1,Interpersonal Beliefs / Emotions,Personalization,Mind Reading

1999,4553,"I’m currently in a very happy and otherwise healthy, long-term romantic relationship for the first time in my life. My boyfriend is a very caring and sensitive guy and we both love each other very much, but I’m concerned that some of my pre-existing sexual issues may cause problems down the road for our relationship. I have primary vaginismus and vulvodynia, and my first sexual experiences were very negative and traumatic. I have been to a gynecologist about these issues and went through physical therapy to try and overcome them, but even after a few years penetration is still painful and sometimes very difficult. While trusting my partner makes a big difference in reducing the amount of pain I’m in during sex, and with my current boyfriend there have been several occasions where it was virtually painless, it’s still a constant factor in my sex-life. While I do enjoy the intimacy of sex with my boyfriend despite this, I have never been able to achieve orgasm no matter what my partner tries to do or for how long. Even with assistance from vibrators it’s virtually impossible, and the only way I’ve managed to achieve orgasm is by my own intervention. I don’t understand why I have this issue, especially because I am very attracted to him. My boyfriend doesn’t complain to me about it or anything like that, but I can tell that it makes him feel self-conscious. I’ve tried explaining to him that it’s not his fault at all, but I worry that he still feels like he’s inadequate.

2012,4574,I am just trying to figure out if my childhood sexplay with a younger same sex cousin was normal or abuse. It all started with her wanting to comb my hair. She had to be 6 or 7 and I about 8 or 9. It went from combing my hair to rubbing my shoulders to us kissing. Eventually it lead to us touching. She would come over every now and then and we would experiment. I think eventually it led to oral by her suggestion because she would engage in the same activity with her mother’s daughter’s friend. I stopped once I got caught dry humping another girl who was around my age. My mom didn’t scold me but had a sit down with myself and the other girl along with the other mom to say it was inappropriate. My cousin would still come over to spend the night and rub against my leg to make me join in sexual play but I would say no firmly and kick her hand or foot off me. I guess my guilt stems from me being older. I should have known better. And I feel absolutely terrible about it. It keeps me up all night sometimes. I don’t remember her trying to force me other than the rubbing leg incident. And I don’t remember me forcing her to do anything. When I think about it I think she was far more advanced mentally than I was. My aunts house did not have the same rules as mine. The kids watched whatever they wanted even R-rated movies as they always had televisions in their room. When I would go over their house they would always call me “slow” because I didn’t get certain things. I guess being that I wasn’t street smart like them and was sheltered (no tv in the rooms only age appropriate shows). Anyway these sexual play encounters have really plagued my with tremendous guilt recently. I don’t want to think that I molested my younger cousin. I turned very mean to her to nip all attempts of sexual play in the bud. To make her hate me was a mechanism to keep us safe and appropriate I guess. She eventually came out as bisexual. I don’t want to think that I did this to her.. Please please help me figure this one out.

He rubbed his parts against hers until he finished. The 2nd night he had her get into shower and kissed her down there. After that it stopped, a few days later I returned. She told me and I took her to the doctor, no signs of penetration. I left him for a few weeks and ended up going back. I know that he is sorry and he says he doesn’t know why he did it. It hasn’t happened again and we all sat down and talked about what happened and I continue to talk with her about how she is feeling and if she wants to stay with dad or not. She says she forgives him, her behavior hasn’t changed. She seems fine, for now. DO you think it is possible to move on past this and be a family or do I just run for the hills? Could it have been his state of mind at the time? I’m so confused whether or not to try to make this work. Am I stupid for staying or is there a chance to save our family.","('forgive', 'she', 'him')",forgive,1,Interpersonal Beliefs / Emotions,Mind Reading,

I really don’t think I am at all, but I keep having thoughts that convince me that I am, and then I convince myself that I’m not, and then the cycle repeats. I’ve mentioned this to my mom and she told me that she would support me no matter what, but that I am NOT a pedophile. That comforted me. I just want to stop the cycle of thinking about me being a pedophile and it ruining my life because I feel like it’s making me more and more anxious. Just to be clear, I am like 90% sure that I’m not, but I need help.

2022,4588,"I have been in a relationship with a man in his mid-40’s for over a year, and as a couple without outside influences we have a supportive, loving and kind relationship, and rarely a disagreement. We moved around the corner from his mum but the last 6 months it appears she has tried to manipulatively break us up. I’ll give you some examples. She came into our home and placed photos of him as a child on our fridge and around the house. We only ever socialise with her, friends her age, and while we are at those occasions she superficially talks up her son’s talents, and looks, and how special he is. My partner lovingly tries to talk about things me or my family are also doing, and every single time she changes the subject, or worse, talks about someone she distantly knows that did the same thing or better. My partner tries to enable me to be proud of myself and my family too, but it’s always to no avail. She has completely shattered my confidence, that I don’t speak much anymore. We’ve been trying for a baby for over a year and she told me when she found out that he can’t afford to have a child because he needs her permission because he owes her money (he doesn’t owe her much). She then tried to convince me to break up with him and go out with my best friend. They have told me for some time the family does not celebrate birthdays, but recently for my partner’s 45th all her friends starting saying his mum was organising a dinner. He said my mother won’t decide for me who I spend my birthday with. I want to spend my day with you.. Next thing, a motorcyclist had bumped the side of her car, no one was injured but he said his mum was in a catatonic state. He then told her she could organise her dinner because she wanted to. We got there, and she had pulled out of her catatonic state pretty brilliantly, with balloons you’d see at 12 year olds party and her two closest friends. I couldn’t get a word in much at this dinner, but one of her friends said she was looking for a husband, and his mum said, darling you should marry her. It’s all caused me so much pain.

I created a fake stalker in order to get reassurance from others that I am worth something. It’s really just me texting myself. I also use it to ask people stuff about me that I am too scared to ask in person (ex: “are you actually her friend or are you faking it” I know logically my friends are actually my friends, but I have awful abandonment issues thanks to my dad. I need this reassurance in order to feel better about myself and affirm that people do actually care about me. I have extremely low self-esteem, as I’m sure you can infer. I have no support system within my family and growing up, I never really had friends until high school. I never want to ask people for reassurance because I do not want to annoy them or chase them away, so the stalker was the easy way out for me. I got pretty wrapped up in being that stalker and definitely got carried away. I texted a person I was friends with as the stalker, but now we are dating. It’s serious and I honestly believe he is the man I will marry. He gives me the reassurance I need when my anxiety is bad and accepts me for who I am so I no longer need that awful stalker in order to function. He is helping me fix the way I think about myself also. I know the stuff the stalker said hurt him because he thought it was hurting me. I am alright with keeping the secret because I do not think he will understand why I did it. I barely understand why I did it. I also do not want to hurt him. I will never do it again. I have no need to. Does creating the stalker make me a bad person? Am I crazy for ever making it up in the first place? Do I need to reveal that it was me all along or can I keep this to myself?

Now she hates psychiatry and anyone associated with it, and won’t let me see anyone. I can’t organise it myself because I’m underage, and I’m terrified I might have another breakdown and actually kill myself this time. How can I seek help without my parent’s involvement?

2047,4613,"Hi. I have had Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder for a number of years. I eventually got help for it, and it went away for a while , but it has now come back again. I hear a voice telling me that if I do not do a particular ritual, I will die. (I also have phobias and general fears). As I have had OCD for many years (since I was 11 years old), I believe I can more or less deal with it. However, in recent months, I have experienced new voices. They are telling me that I do not love my boyfriend. They do not require any kind of ritualistic behaviour and therefore i cannot make them go away. I constantly have 2 different thoughts and i argue with myself all the time in my head. 'Could they be a different form of OCD? or could it be some form of schizophrenia? Either way what is the best approach to deal with them and finally make them go away? Thank you very much in advance for your help.","('love', 'I', 'boyfriend')",love,1,Interpersonal Beliefs / Emotions,Magnification,

He accidentally left his email open on my computer and I found an email from him to an escort describing the type of fantasy he wanted with her. He said that he wanted her to take him hostage and use him for her pleasure. He wanted to serve her. He said that he enjoyed strap-on play, golden shower, boot, foot and rear-end worship. I am so shocked by all of this and am trying to look for answers as to why and how someone develops fetishes like this. With me he is most gentle and loving and this is a completely different person than the one I know. Please help me to understand this. Does this mean he is gay or bi-sexual?

Over the last month she has been behaving distant and acting depressed and says she’s just missing her mom and trying to cope and deal with the loss. She never wants to touch, show affection, or be intimate with me anymore. She gets angry with me over things that were her her own decisions. I have read a lot on depression lately… the problem I am having is that she doesn’t act this way with everyone. She never wants to just joke with me or have fun with me…but she continues to joke and have fun with her other friends. I know that she feels safe with me and maybe feels like when its just us she can just be sad… but I am hurt.

2075,4635,"Hey, I’ve got a pretty complex issue here with a lot of nuances. To put it simply, my girlfriend has BPD with the three extra disorders, Eating, Depression, and anxiety. After 9 months I’m really struggling to find the love in the relationship. One month ago I did something awful to her that was related with my PTSD, and now I’m just trying to pick up the pieces because of guilt. Because of my desperate behaviors, I’m worried that she has taken this opportunity to control me. Currently, there is a lot of me giving to her and not receiving the same effort back. There are a lot of fights and daily depression that effects both our lives heavily. I guess, I’m trying to figure out if I should break up with her because the BPD has become too overwhelming and manipulative. I can’t even play guitar anymore because she thinks that me learning will compromise her identity that has latched onto her guitar skills. All of my hobbies are now competitions in her mind.

2076,4635,"Hey, I’ve got a pretty complex issue here with a lot of nuances. To put it simply, my girlfriend has BPD with the three extra disorders, Eating, Depression, and anxiety. After 9 months I’m really struggling to find the love in the relationship. One month ago I did something awful to her that was related with my PTSD, and now I’m just trying to pick up the pieces because of guilt. Because of my desperate behaviors, I’m worried that she has taken this opportunity to control me. Currently, there is a lot of me giving to her and not receiving the same effort back. There are a lot of fights and daily depression that effects both our lives heavily. I guess, I’m trying to figure out if I should break up with her because the BPD has become too overwhelming and manipulative. I can’t even play guitar anymore because she thinks that me learning will compromise her identity that has latched onto her guitar skills. All of my hobbies are now competitions in her mind. I love her extremely, but all of this daily drama is killing us. I think it just comes down to figuring out if there is a future for us anymore.

Now I don’t get that, but this time around I have headaches whenever the cough occurs. It doesn’t even really stay after the coughing stops. I would cough for a few minutes and the headache is usually coming and going with the cough. I’ve gone to the doctor several times for this and was tested for asthma, but that came back negative.

I believe my father wants to kill me and my mother, i believe my sister is jealous i get more time with my mom, and i hate being happy. Whenever i get happy i need to remind myself i dont deserve to feel that or that its all fake and none if it will last. I self harm. My grades are poor and I prepare to commit suicide within the next three years, or maybe next year, or before college. I dont want to hurt my mother just in case she really does love me. I believe everyone will leave me and have isolated myself. Everything makes me cry. Help.","('love', 'she', 'me')",love,1,Interpersonal Beliefs / Emotions,All-or-nothing thinking,Mind Reading
2106,4667,"I’ve been professionally diagnosed with depression and briefly received counseling, though my grandmother cancelled my treatment and refuses to continue it. My father cannot convince her to change her mind and my mother is out of the picture. My father supports me, though won’t take any action of his own because he doesn’t believe depression is real. My grandmother refuses to attempt an understanding of depression, and I have nowhere to turn. I’ve asked many times over the course of over entire year for her to allow me help again ever since she has cancelled my counseling, but all my efforts have proven pointless. My condition is worsening and I’m experiencing passive suicidal thoughts, and though I’ve told my family about this, they have purposely done nothing to help me or to get me help. My grandma forces me to literally pretend I’m not depressed, and my father won’t acknowledge me when I mention my depression. Essentially, my family is denying me help and I have nowhere to turn. I haven’t slept for more than a few hours every night night in maybe weeks, I have sleep paralysis and terrifying nightmares relating to my depression, and I battle the urge to self-harm every time I’m alone and whenever my thoughts begin to take over. I’m scared that I’ll soon turn to suicide, and I have nowhere and no one to turn to for help.

I have been with my husband for 5 years and my step daughter is now 11 years old. A couple years ago, she started to act out and become disrespectful and lazy. We tried everything to discipline and teach her how to be kind and empathetic, but no improvement was made. At this time, we spoke to her mom and step dad and all agreed she should be tested for a disability. Turns out she has Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), but her mom refuses to consider medication or alternative holistic approaches to helping in this matter. My husband has zero legal right in any medical treatments or therapy until she is 16. Long story short, this last summer she started to put herself in between my husband and I when he would show me affection. We put an end to that quickly and explained that we will not tolerate her jealousy or manipulative tactics to separate us. Recently, she told her grandma that she is scared of me. This resulted in a massive fight between the grandparents and my husband and I. We discussed this matter with the daughter and asked if she was truly scared of me and she said she was joking. She has been saying things like this about her step-dad for years now, however we know he treats her very well and there is no reason for these cruel remarks. She has used manipulation techniques like this for a couple years and started by playing the mom and dad against each other.

This vicious circle is pretty much part of my everyday routine. The scariest thing by far was my recent revelation of my sociopathic behavior. Yeah, I’ve tried to justify why I do the things I do, but it’s a waste of time. Deep down, I don’t believe my petty justifications anyhow.

During a very recent hospitalization, I also began utilizing a journal to get my thoughts out in a private manner. I have an incredible support system I rarely utilize. I am struggling with a number of issues. I suck at reaching out before making terrible decisions such as self harm and drug use. I am an alcoholic and a drug addict who attends AA meetings regularly but have yet to pick up my 24-hour chip. I feel as if I’m not ready to surrender and work a program. I am, however, terrified of the consequences of alcoholism/drug use. Another fellowship I was previously a member of states these consequences at the start of every meeting: jails, institutions, and death. I lost one of my best friends in March to addiction. I have also seen many others lose their lives. While heroin is not my DOC, I feel as though any substance I choose to use will inevitably lead to some kind of consequence. I am in such a conundrum.

Following the worst inpatient experience of my life, I am also struggling with the emotional pain of being on a very small amount of numerous medications.

I was simultaneously feeling suicidal due to just being put on Latuda.

Following being inpatient, they told me at my new job that while I had been out of work for two weeks, they had to fill my position. I burned bridges, lost my sponsor as a result of using the day they let me go, and cut myself for the first time in two years.

2154,4733,"I finally started seeing a therapist slightly over a month ago and it’s been great and I love my therapist but I’m not really sure to say whether I’ve been making progress or not. I say this because while I’ve experienced a lot of personal growth just within the past month, I can’t help but have some concerns. I’ll start by saying that this year has been a lot for me. I dropped out of college in May due to stress that inhibited me from functioning for months after (to this day I’m still trying to get my life back), after months of persistent mood swings, anxiety, and mild psychosis I went to see a psychiatrist in September (I think) that completely dismissed my concerns by saying I had “mild depression and terrible coping skills”;despite me mentioning I’d attempted suicide over 4 times!; which subsequently sent me into a severe depressive episode after the session. My mood never really lifted, and in November, 2 days before my birthday, I broke up with my boyfriend of over a year. The experience in itself was gut-wrenching and the week following even more so. I had a really bad breakdown one night, broke a bunch of things, wanted to kill myself but blacked out before I could do any damage. I figured things would only get worse until the next week when my mood did a complete 180 and I suddenly knew the answers to life, the fact my ex wasn’t talking to me no longer bothered me, I spent over $200 in 2 days (and the rest throughout the following week) etc. etc. (insert various symptoms of mania here). My therapist told me I seemed more bipolar than just depressed but it seems she dropped the diagnosis as she hasn’t mentioned it since our first session and gave me a diagnosis of “anxiety disorder” upon our second meeting. Anyway, the episode of what I’d call mania lasted for basically a month up to the point I was certain I was god and was considering starting my own religion, but then on Christmas night depression slapped me in the face and I’ve been very down ever since. I feel like I’ve lost all my direction and drive and my hopes for my future are once again slim.

I say this because while I’ve experienced a lot of personal growth just within the past month, I can’t help but have some concerns. I’ll start by saying that this year has been a lot for me. I dropped out of college in May due to stress that inhibited me from functioning for months after (to this day I’m still trying to get my life back), after months of persistent mood swings, anxiety, and mild psychosis I went to see a psychiatrist in September (I think) that completely dismissed my concerns by saying I had “mild depression and terrible coping skills”;despite me mentioning I’d attempted suicide over 4 times!; which subsequently sent me into a severe depressive episode after the session. My mood never really lifted, and in November, 2 days before my birthday, I broke up with my boyfriend of over a year. The experience in itself was gut-wrenching and the week following even more so. I had a really bad breakdown one night, broke a bunch of things, wanted to kill myself but blacked out before I could do any damage. I figured things would only get worse until the next week when my mood did a complete 180 and I suddenly knew the answers to life, the fact my ex wasn’t talking to me no longer bothered me, I spent over $200 in 2 days (and the rest throughout the following week) etc. etc. (insert various symptoms of mania here). My therapist told me I seemed more bipolar than just depressed but it seems she dropped the diagnosis as she hasn’t mentioned it since our first session and gave me a diagnosis of “anxiety disorder” upon our second meeting. Anyway, the episode of what I’d call mania lasted for basically a month up to the point I was certain I was god and was considering starting my own religion, but then on Christmas night depression slapped me in the face and I’ve been very down ever since. I feel like I’ve lost all my direction and drive and my hopes for my future are once again slim.

Thing is, my mood goes up and down — sort of like Bipolar, but the majority of the time, I’m depressed. when i’m in an “up” mood, (which is more like unbelievable anger rather than elation, with the occasional happy high,) I hate myself for even thinking it, and punish myself for being so selfish — not thinking about what it’d do to my family, but when I’m in a depressed mood, It seems to be the only way out, and the thought is a sort of stimulant.

2185,4771,"For nearly two years, I’ve dealt with increasingly worse anxiety symptoms. The biggest issue is my inability to sleep when I am away from home, including difficulties sleeping in my own dorm. I’ve dealt with these sleeping issues for over a year and generally find that when I can’t sleep, my mind focuses on all the things wrong with the room I’m in (too quiet, too hot, etc). I’m also constantly going through a mental list of assignments, meetings, and events, and rewriting the list in my planner each day. Usually, I just run through the list in my head, but I have also noticed that I will speak out loud to myself while walking to and from class and run through the list while making a plan of what order to complete those tasks. I’ll run through this order multiple times, typically until I get to wherever I’m going or encounter other people because I’m worried they will judge me for speaking to myself. Even when I’ve accomplished the tasks I set out to do on a particular day, I still find myself thinking about the items on that list and panicking about how much more I have to do. As a result, I feel as if I can never fully relax. I’m always worried that I’m going to forget something on that list and that something bad will happen because I don’t complete that particular thing. I also find that I have difficulty concentrating because I’m constantly thinking about these things. When I have difficulty concentrating and feel really anxious about something, generally experiencing a heavy feeling in my chest and difficulty breathing, I end up picking at the skin around my nails, and on particularly bad days, I do this until they bleed. Although I generally fear that others will judge me for my actions, I find that picking helps me calm down and refocus myself. While my worries about school are generally my main focus, I often find myself worrying about my relationships as well, particularly that my friends don’t really like me and that I don’t actually have feelings for my boyfriend. I’ve recently begun to fear that I have OCD rather than just anxiety. I’ve brought some of these topics up to my doctor, but should I voice my worries that the anxiety I experience seems to mirror some aspects of OCD?

2215,4820,"3 weeks ago, I went to my very first psychiatrist appointment. It was a pretty big milestone for me as I haven’t been in contact with any mental health professional since I was 15, and I was really looking forward to finally getting the help I need. The whole experience was dissatisfactory overall, from filling out forms in the waiting room, to waiting for the doctor to actually come in for hours, I had switched from anxious but hopeful to frustrated and wishing I could just get it over with. Eventually, she (the psychiatrist) called me in and we talked for no more than 5 minutes. She asked me many questions but by the end she was completely dismissive about everything I confided in her about and ushered me out the door saying “I am a psychiatrist, I deal with people who have REAL problems, which you do not have, just bad coping skills.” Ah, yes, “bad coping skills”. I left with only one question in my mind: If I don’t have any problems, what do you think those bad coping skills come from? To say I was upset upon my arrival at home would be a massive understatement. It took everything within me to not express my rage. I wanted to scream, I wanted to cut, I wanted to burn my entire house down even if it meant death to my whole family just so I could die in it – but that’s not me. I hate bringing others into my personal problems. And so, I crashed into an extreme depressive episode in which I spent the evening crying for 7 hours, didn’t get out of bed for days, didn’t eat for more than a week (I’m only recently starting to eat at least one meal a day) and spent every waking moment feeling like I need to jump off a bridge because even the thought of my own existence makes me feel incurably sick to the stomach and pained in the head. Currently, I’m doing significantly better, and aim to contact a new therapist within the next week or so, but that initial experience is something I doubt I’ll ever forget, but honestly, I just wonder what’s the purpose of it all, as my desire for escape from existence runs its course, even when I’m not in any way depressed at all.

2221,4834,"Hi, In the past month my girlfriend experienced something strange four times. She was in a manipulative/emotionally abusive relationship that lasted 9 years, and ended recently. She’s been struggling because of it, and I’ve been helping her. She self-harmed, had suicidal thoughts, and attempted suicide. When things got overly stressful, she had anxiety attacks where she would convulse(?)–still conscious, barely being able to talk, but her entire body tensed up and standing still, especially her feet and hands. They lasted around 10 minutes, and she’d feel sore afterwards. She’s been getting better, being happier as time passes and able to deal with things better. But just recently, when something that reminds her of traumatic experiences happened, she’d go in a “trance.” For example, I accidentally said something her ex would say, and she took it the wrong way, as if it was manipulative and blaming her for something I did. She started staring into nothingness. When trying to talk to her, she’d either not react, or barely say anything. When trying to touch her, she’d look very scared and pull away, telling me not to touch her. When asking her to tell me my name, she’d say her ex’s name. When doing nothing, she’d just stare into nothing, staying still. When getting too close, she’d react rashly to get away and tell me to stay away. After a while of trying to snap her out of it, she’d walk away into another room, often the bedroom. Last time, she went to the washing machine, then the bedroom, and told me to stop asking her what my name was, that I always do that, even though it was the first time during that “trance” that I asked. So she’s at least minimally aware of her surroundings, and the trances may be connected? During those four times, she was unconscious, seemed extremely traumatized, and thought I was her ex. It lasts 15-20 minutes. She snaps back (once after I made her say my actual name a few times, another after I kept telling her I loved her she shed a tear and snap back, the last one after she fell asleep for a couple of minutes) and doesn’t remember anything whatsoever. She feels empty, but in an okay mood, like nothing happened. I’d like to now what’s happening, and if it’s dangerous in any way. Thanks for your time.","('help', 'I', 'her')",help,0,Supportive Actions,Mind Reading,

Growing up I didn’t have very many friends, and the ones I did have emotionally abused me in the relationship from 3rd grade all the way up to 6th grade. My father was very emotionally neglectful and never gave me his approval. When I was 9 years old I had my first dream of killing someone, but I don’t remember the dream as a negative, I remember being more fascinated. Theses dream accrued now and again through the passing years. I have been also diagnosed with depression and severe anxiety. I only really have one or two friends at a time because I have a very hard time trusting new people and are very suspicious of them at the beginning of a relationship. And somebody can only screw me over If I let them, by either trusting them or letting down my guard. Pity the fool who decides to earn my trust and screw me, they will know what it feels like to hurt. If I don’t destroy them in that instant, I will keep my enemy close until I have everything I need to bring him all the way down to nothing. And ever since I was young I have been able to make anybody feel any emotion I want them to feel. I can go from happy to cry just by choice if I choose to do so. I feel disconnected with my emotions and they are more something I use to fit in. Around 6th grade, I learned that retaining appearance was very important to my future with relationships. So I started paying attention to other people’s emotions and listening to others to understand and see what pain, regret, shame, confidence, etc look like.

Growing up I didn’t have very many friends, and the ones I did have emotionally abused me in the relationship from 3rd grade all the way up to 6th grade. My father was very emotionally neglectful and never gave me his approval. When I was 9 years old I had my first dream of killing someone, but I don’t remember the dream as a negative, I remember being more fascinated. Theses dream accrued now and again through the passing years. I have been also diagnosed with depression and severe anxiety. I only really have one or two friends at a time because I have a very hard time trusting new people and are very suspicious of them at the beginning of a relationship. And somebody can only screw me over If I let them, by either trusting them or letting down my guard. Pity the fool who decides to earn my trust and screw me, they will know what it feels like to hurt. If I don’t destroy them in that instant, I will keep my enemy close until I have everything I need to bring him all the way down to nothing. And ever since I was young I have been able to make anybody feel any emotion I want them to feel. I can go from happy to cry just by choice if I choose to do so. I feel disconnected with my emotions and they are more something I use to fit in. Around 6th grade, I learned that retaining appearance was very important to my future with relationships. So I started paying attention to other people’s emotions and listening to others to understand and see what pain, regret, shame, confidence, etc look like. Since that point, I have had no problem obtaining a relationship if I want one.","('abuse', 'I', 'relationship')",abuse,2,Relational Harm,No Distortion,

2234,4843,"I have a very unique situation. I met my husband about 5 years ago and we married 2 years ago. When we first met, he told me that he lived with his half-sister whom he had only met 10 years earlier. She was adopted and raised by another family, and had found him 10 years earlier. She was/is divorced and has been engaged several times, but never remarried. Well, we dated several months and fell in love. His half-sister seemed to be very upset that he was dating someone and refused to meet me for several months. At some point he confessed to me that he had a sexual relationship with her, not long after meeting her, but that it had long been “over” and he then considered her “just his sister”. (I’ve researched this phenomenon and found that it’s actually fairly common among long lost opposite sex family members who find each other later on..) Anyway, since this sexual relationship had been years before, I was fairly understanding but was still taken aback.","('date', 'he', 'someone')",date,0,Supportive Actions,No Distortion,

Firstly, I want to say that I always knew that I’m different from others. even when I was little I had trouble to fit in because I didn’t know how to normally communicate. every time I meet people I don’t talk or I talk like a crazy. I also dress up little different, so every one first thought is that this girl is weird. I have had 5 friend in my life and now just left two. others grew up like normal kids so I became too weird for them. even when I was in first grades in school teachers were forcing others to talk with me because when other were playing I was just drawing, not even paying attention. I’m not even going to mention my obsessions, weird talks about subjects that no one cares about. everyone was calling me philosopher. I also could never consider someone’s eyes I just improved that a year ago. also, I show many other symptoms except maybe not understanding what are people telling me. sometimes my grandma and mum tell me that I’m like a brick not understanding what people tell me but I don’t really know why are they saying it. this is my suspicion about Asperger, but what I really worry about is delusions. when I was 14 or so I was convinced that I am a werewolf even though I don’t believe in them. I believed it so much I would do stupid things like I would eat raw meat (which is funny because I don’t like meat), having dreams about me shapeshifting and if I would discover little scratch next morning it was because it really happened. I even had “hallucinations”. in the mirror, I could see my eyes turning yellow. it was much worse than it sounds. this ended in a year or 2. but then next started. I believed I was a medium and I was literally seeing auras and ghosts (which is also funny because I don’t believe in them). I could hear voices and breath. and this ended in a few months. there is something about aliens but I don’t consider it important. PS parents don’t believe me. There are other things too but I’m over word limitation. (From the USA)","('believe', 'parents', 'me')",believe,1,Interpersonal Beliefs / Emotions,Labeling,

I was like that when I was younger, when other kids were screaming, I was painting or playing quietly. I had friends who told me they wished I was dead, tried to drown me at the pool or always saying mean things, like I would never be good at anything. My mom talked to other parents but they didn’t mind. Growing up I was the same me, I didn’t like going to clubs or getting drunk but most of the people I knew did. I never criticized anyone, it just wasn’t for me. I’m 24 and I don’t have friends, most of people I know just want the same things they wanted at 21: alcohol, parties and whenever they see me with a book then ‘I’m a loser’. I do have a boyfriend. He finds interesting the way I am and doesn’t judge me for being like the others. He does have friends, and I feel sad when he’s sharing with his friends and I see it’s great but I never found that on my own. Most of his friends get along with me, they say I’m a good friend and I feel happy, but I would like to have my own friends too. My boyfriend’s a lot more social than me so even if he’s just watching a game with his friends I wish I could have something like that too. I went to a therapist and she told me I was an ‘old cat lady in a younger body’ and that I was depressed but I don’t feel like that, I just enjoy different things. I’d rather stay home and play board games than going out and forgetting everything the next day. I have gone to clubs, but I don’t like to go every weekend. That’s why most of the friends I had called me a freak until I decided I was sick of having friends who weren’t really nice, or when they stopped talking to me. Is there something wrong with me?

My mom talked to other parents but they didn’t mind. Growing up I was the same me, I didn’t like going to clubs or getting drunk but most of the people I knew did. I never criticized anyone, it just wasn’t for me. I’m 24 and I don’t have friends, most of people I know just want the same things they wanted at 21: alcohol, parties and whenever they see me with a book then ‘I’m a loser’. I do have a boyfriend. He finds interesting the way I am and doesn’t judge me for being like the others. He does have friends, and I feel sad when he’s sharing with his friends and I see it’s great but I never found that on my own. Most of his friends get along with me, they say I’m a good friend and I feel happy, but I would like to have my own friends too. My boyfriend’s a lot more social than me so even if he’s just watching a game with his friends I wish I could have something like that too. I went to a therapist and she told me I was an ‘old cat lady in a younger body’ and that I was depressed but I don’t feel like that, I just enjoy different things. I’d rather stay home and play board games than going out and forgetting everything the next day. I have gone to clubs, but I don’t like to go every weekend. That’s why most of the friends I had called me a freak until I decided I was sick of having friends who weren’t really nice, or when they stopped talking to me. Is there something wrong with me? Since everyone says I have to make an effort I don’t know if I have to change who I am so people can like me and not make fun of me.

He works very occasionally at a community college and does have his retirement income.  I have multiple medical concerns and 3 years after he retired, we downsized so that I could retire as well. This was 5 years ago and as it is, I have no chance of retiring.  Spouse has told me, “Sure, you can retire.  We will just be homeless”. I feel stuck working and feeling fatigued and sick and really resent him. I think he is anxious about working as he has been retired for 7 1/2 years. I have encouraged him to do volunteer work so he has something to be passionate about. Overall, his retiring early has affected me greatly and not him. He has a wonderful life of going to the gym and doing some housework and laundry. I have a good job and got a 30% pay raise last year. That was a total disincentive for him. I want us to work on retirement together, not me working till I die and him having a great time. I am angry and becoming bitter and I don’t like me the way I am. Whenever we talk about this issue, he looks at it as a problem with me. I need to be more positive, which I know is true.  How do I get his actions to affect him? I am planning on a major cruise with my daughter and don’t plan to ask him to go. I figure, if he wants to come, he can pay his own way. Is that a wrong attitude?

I also had inappropriate touching from strangers while out with friends and I always felt that I was somehow singled out by these characters. I literally felt I had a label on my forehead saying touch me. Thankfully I married to a wonderful man and I’m doing well career wise. Except for this aspect.

I get frustrated with the app because I always restart the song after I sing a few lyrics. This is also irritating because no matter the amount of water I consume, my throat is dry, and (I believe) interferes with my singing. Whenever I open my mic. I can feel that my throat become dry, and this happens ESPECIALLY before, and during a conversation. It doesn’t matter the amount of water I consume, because I don’t feel satisfied — but ordinarily, I am very DEHYDRATED! –and I ABSOLUTELY, NEED to consume more liquids, but I never feel thirsty unless I eat something, but I simply eat too many things (that are processed!) I’ve tried to rid myself of this addiction, but that would mean cutting all processed things, because I couldn’t handle it otherwise. I have done that not long ago, but was convinced that a small bowl of something would not kill me. I hesitated to eat it, but as soon as I did, I could not stop myself. I didn’t feel guilty, but I felt bad because I am addicted. I love to talk with others, and I’d consider myself social, but these last few months — I’ve felt so anxious to talk, that I began to assume I wouldn’t say a word, therefore, I felt no stress. I do feel like I’ve been improving, but I guess I feel a little lonely sometimes. I don’t have any friends, except for one that I interact with – on social media outlets. I find it annoying that my mother tries to tell me the things I did, or that I lived. As a kid, I felt rejected all the time, and was often ridiculed at school, and also by the few kids in my neighbourhood, I tried so hard to impress. My mom says that I’d deliberately hurt kids, (even run them over with my bike!) She said that I would laugh at the child whilst they cried, but I have zero recollection of this! — I remember people hurting me, and not the other way around!

2304,4926,"I had a highly traumatic childhood of emotional abuse, smothering, and neglect at the hands of a substance-abusing parent. I was also molested through my diaper by older children as a toddler. I believe these led to the development of my severe, chronic dissociate disorder and OCD. I say all this for context, not as an excuse. As a kid, I had horrible violent and sexually deviant intrusive thoughts as well as PGAD in conjunction with them. I hated them and wanted nothing to do with them and tried to suppress them, but was convinced I was evil. Therapy has helped me realize they weren’t my fault back then. However, as a teen, I decided those thoughts were inevitable and began to let awful scenarios play out in my head instead of rejecting them and masturbated to some of them. I found online communities of people who shared these thoughts but considered them harmless “kinks” when explored only through fiction. I never intended to act on any of them and considered them divorced from my true opinions, but now I see they were still affecting me and I want nothing to do with them. I don’t believe an immoral fantasy can be harmless anymore. I became hyper-sexual and a chronic masturbator. My twin cousins who are 7 years younger than me slept in my room when they visited my house. I was around 15-17. When I knew they had fallen asleep, I silently masturbated. It happened a couple times. I think they were asleep and I don’t think they knew, but it haunts me everyday and the remorse and self-disgust I feel is indescribable. It had nothing to do with their presence, I just wanted to orgasm, but it was SO irresponsible of me no matter how careful I was. In the only other instance of this, I once compulsively touched myself through my pants in an upstairs room of their house, only for a sec, planning to stop before anyone entered. One of them walked in unexpectedly and I was mortified, but pretended I just had an itch, apologized, and went to wash my hands. I don’t know if I can tell my therapist, but it’s eating me alive. I don’t know if these instances count legally as indecency to a minor. If so, I’m ready to turn myself in. I want to kill myself.","('hate', 'I', 'them')",hate,1,Interpersonal Beliefs / Emotions,Magnification,

My 31 year old stepdaughter has had drug problems for 15 years &  just up & left yet another rehab while on Vivitrol. She goes into detox hospitals and then gets transferred to residential recovery houses, which she stays at for a couple weeks then up and leaves and then loops through this process again and again. I know she has said she is empty inside and has talked abt hurting herself, but it’s hard to tell if she actually is being honest about that or is using that to get back in rehab places after she has left. She doesn’t seem to have reasons for leaving any of these places. Though, she acts very immature and does seem to struggle with authority and taking responsibility for anything. She has been in trouble with law, and while once she cared very much for her looks, she now has covered her body in tattoos. She has a young daughter, who she OD’ed in front of (she no longer has custody) & parents who are desperate to get her help and finally get her on the right path. But she seems to easily disconnect from what she’s done and does &  doesn’t seems to care how much she is hurting and worrying everyone. .

He is a realist, recovering alcohol of 25 yrs, does not believe in Western Medicine and speaks the truth about everything regardless of feelings. We have had challenges from day one but the most recent challenge is that he has enacted stipulations that we will not attend public events together, we will not eat at restaurants together, we will not attend a movie together, etc – all because he believes I am unable to control my behavior/emotions. For example, we attended an event in which I ran into a male who had caused a serious injury to myself in which I almost lost a leg. I have not seen this male since the final court date.The male dragged out things out for years causing me more money and frustration to collect on his criminal restitution. Yes, I was surprised to see him at the event, told my bf who the male was and expressed disgust of seeing him again. I did not approach the male or speak to him. The whole incident/my behavior last possibly 5 mins before I collected myself and went back to having a good time. Since that event, my bf believes I have anger issues and can not be trusted to “stay in the moment” with him therefore he will not attend any more events with me because he “will not put himself” in that situation again. Nothing I did or said should have affected my bf therefore I am confused to say the least. He explained it as why should he feel uncomfortable or give support to me for something I should have dealt with already. He does not want to go to the movies because I once mentioned I was uncomfortable in the seats however we have since gone to two movies with the new seating and I have been fine. He knows that but for some reason has decided all of sudden to issue this stipulation. I believe this is controlling manipulative behavior, possibly passive aggressive and punishment for things I may have done or said that he will not forgive me for. I do not believe this is normal but he has me almost convinced I am at fault for these stipulations. Please help me understand what is going on.

2386,5027,"Hi there, I’ve been in a relationship for 6 months with my boyfriend and honestly this is my first  real relationship. I know I have room to grow but what he has expressed to me is that I have inappropriate emotional dependent relationships with my friends. I disagree and of course I get upset with him if he says harsh things about them which then he counters that I am not loyal to him and I should just accept his brash, rude remarks (because he’s right?). For example he says all my friends are stupid, and they are going nowhere. Most of my friends are actors and like me we are figuring it out, the business is not easy. I tell him if that if he respected me he would not talk about the people I care about that way- which then he counters that I’m more emotionally invested in them. Furthermore we’ve fought about me having gay guy friends, he says its not because they are gay but because they don’t stand for what we are trying to build together. He then just recently said it’s because they are male and I shouldn’t have any male friends, that he should be the only man in my life. I’m not so attached to my guy friends but him saying all this makes me uncomfortable. I don’t see why if my relationships are strictly platonic that I have to cut them off. My bottom line fear is that he’s being controlling. I KNOW he loves me very much and out of respect to me he would cut any of his friends off if I did not like them but I would never do that! (unless extreme circumstances) And he does not see any of his girl friends any more. I’m scared to talk to him about this again because he will think I care more about my friends then him (something he is always saying) and end the relationship. I don’t want it to end over some guys friends I have but I don’t think it’s fair I have to cut them off. What should I do?

I know I have room to grow but what he has expressed to me is that I have inappropriate emotional dependent relationships with my friends. I disagree and of course I get upset with him if he says harsh things about them which then he counters that I am not loyal to him and I should just accept his brash, rude remarks (because he’s right?). For example he says all my friends are stupid, and they are going nowhere. Most of my friends are actors and like me we are figuring it out, the business is not easy. I tell him if that if he respected me he would not talk about the people I care about that way- which then he counters that I’m more emotionally invested in them. Furthermore we’ve fought about me having gay guy friends, he says its not because they are gay but because they don’t stand for what we are trying to build together. He then just recently said it’s because they are male and I shouldn’t have any male friends, that he should be the only man in my life. I’m not so attached to my guy friends but him saying all this makes me uncomfortable. I don’t see why if my relationships are strictly platonic that I have to cut them off. My bottom line fear is that he’s being controlling. I KNOW he loves me very much and out of respect to me he would cut any of his friends off if I did not like them but I would never do that!

She sounds just like me but isn’t, she bosses me around all the time telling me what to do what to wear telling me when to go to bed, saying things when we’re in public like. “They don’t like you, they’re probably laughing at you.” They probably think you’re weird.’ I remember being 5 years old in kindergarten and her telling me to raise my hand and what to ask the teacher. I’ve told my therapist about this and I’ve told counselors at my school I even told my mother when I was little, all of them brush it off saying “that’s just your inner voice.” Or they misinterpret what I mean, most of the time when you hear voices its outside of your head or it comes on later on in life. But mines has always been there since I was little. I’ve been thinking that maybe my mother had a miscarriage and I had a twin sister and maybe I absorb her soul and now we’re part of each other and sharing the same bodies. I haven’t told anyone this I know they’ll say “stop acting crazy” Or that’s ridiculous. Sometimes I do things and don’t remember them, I don’t know if this is DID I didn’t have a bad childhood or anything, I asked my mother and she says I don’t have another personality that I need to stop. I told my therapist and she keeps saying so you hear “voices.” I keep telling her no I don’t hear “voices” I hear myself but there’s two different versions there’s me and there’s her she sounds just like but isn’t me. And no one seems to understand this. I’ve had dr and dp since I was young too most people get that later on.

2411,5051,"So to start off my mom and I didn’t always have a terrible relationship. I think things started changing when I started, well, gaining weight. I was becoming fat and she used to scream at me for it. In the beginning, whenever she did call me fat and ugly she apologized later and this continued till I was like 13. She did hit me with a rolling pin or her hands and I used to be so scared to walk past her when she was in a bad mood cause I was afraid she’d hit me if I was in her reach. I remember this one time I was on the ground and she was kicking me and just kept going. Then as the teen years went by I was in that typical unreasonable stage where at one point I told her I hated her which got me a quick beating. When I finally passed that stage when I was 17 and I didn’t get beatings anymore. I also started making effort to drop the weight however she never tried to support me, like she’d pay for the gym, she’d push me everyday but the moment she was in a bad mood she’d call me a fat and useless daughter, which really hurt my feelings cause I was genuinely trying to lose weight. She told me everyday if I kept being fat I’d get bullied and in my mind I always felt like she was my only bully. Every time i spoke to her, she’d sort of look at me in disgust and say, “Go away I don’t really need to look at somebody who looks like an elephant at this time of the day” or she’d call me a useful lump or something like that. She is slim and beautiful, of course. I stay locked in my room because I know if I come out and have a conversation it would turn to the topic of my weight and end in a fight.  She has a problem with that as well and has called me dull countless times.","('hate', 'I', 'her')",hate,1,Interpersonal Beliefs / Emotions,Mind Reading,Fortune-telling
2412,5055,"I am looking for some insight on a very personal matter that no body knows about me. Not even my parents. I have seen numerous posts on reddit that detail early signs and symptoms of psychopathy and I’m just a bit concerned. I do by no means believe I am a psychopath but I am aware that I may be a bit more prone to mental illness (My granddad and Aunt were Manic Depressive). I know I should seek proper counseling and not ask questions online but I’m curious to hear your opinions on the matter. What it boils down to are my actions as a child. It began even before my stepfather (who played a huge role in my teenage turmoil) came in to my life. I have a memory (it grows weaker by the day) of being around 4-5 years old and sadistically chasing my mums canaries around a room with a hammer. Although I don’t remember killing them I do remember running around the room with the hammer and also when my mum asked me what happened to them. I asked her about this recently and she said she cant remember anything. The next instance was when I was 9 years old. My Stepfather had a baby boy with my mum. There were multiple occasion where I would twist his arm to make him cry, the crying would irritate me and I would twist it more because of this. Unfortunately I broke his arm one time (This my parents found out about of course). I don’t want any judgement on this please. The baby was only maybe 8 months old and of course I am disgusted by what I did but I’m looking for insight not j udgement. The last sadistic behavior I remember was at about 10-11 years old. One of my cats gave birth to 4 kittens and I am pretty sure I caused the death of all four. I would be in the room on my own and I would press down on their stomachs to make them squeal. Although they never died on the spot they passed away pretty quickly and I am sure I caused some major internal injuries. I remember some of the moments very clearly but what I remember mostly was the guilt. In particular when my brother would scream in pain I would have the feeling wash over me instantly and I would keep doing it for some reason. It was the same feeling I got from telling him that his mam and dad weren’t ever coming back (Parents gone in to the shop, me and brother in the car) I will finish up by saving that I consider my self a normal young adult right now. I have some issues with anxiety but I put that down to smoking grass. But I’m just wondering if this behavior as a child could manifest itself again in my later years when my mental health starts to deteriorate. P.S I have a great relationship now with my family and stepfather who actually provided my mum with two more kids after this. They mean the world to me so I’m curious as to where this behavior stemmed.","('believe', 'I', 'means')",believe,1,Interpersonal Beliefs / Emotions,Should statements,

2415,5060,"Inside of this fleshy prison live the three of us: Harry, George, and me. Normally, we get along perfectly, each respecting one another’s problems, such as George’s ‘depression’ and Harry’s ‘schizophrenia’ (both of which have not been diagnosed or discussed with a professional). Unlike the other two, I seemingly lack a few emotions, such as grief, remorse, and empathy. Normally, this is more of a strength than a weakness, but as of late, it has been rather difficult to deal with. It’s perfectly normal for me to experience urges to kill living creatures or to break inanimate objects, and these urges are understood by Harry and George. However, with each passing day these urges seem to grow stronger, and Harry and George seem to grow more…’on edge’. When we discuss the subject, the others seem to react with more fear, or aggression, than they used to, and they don’t seem to understand my situation as well as they used to. Previously, I could control my urges perfectly. I fidget a lot, which used to calm the urges, and I can also be quite destructive if I want something (I chewed through a television remote so that I could play with the rubber buttons inside), which also helped. Leaving windows open and then killing the insects that entered the house was another good way to calm myself. However, none of these methods seem to do much good anymore. I want something more, something bigger. Hunting is out of the question for me – there isn’t anywhere to go in my local area and if I ask an adult it will arouse suspicion (they all believe that Harry, George, and myself are a singular, ‘normal’ entity). With each day these urges growing stronger, I also grow more impatient and frustrated with tiny details. Things – and people – are bothering me more and more, and this is encouraging my fantasies of killing them. There’s only two people I would never be able to kill, and they’re not a part of my family, which means I have to control myself greatly each day around the people I’m supposed to ‘love’. With all of that said, it brings me onto my questions. What can I do to calm my desire to kill? And, lastly, is calming my urges that only way to make Harry and George feel comfortable with me again?

2441,5081,"It all started with me intaking a syrop that contained THC, I was told that I would not experience any feelings of being high but it would help with my pain. ( I have pelvic floor dysfunction). As I took it, about two hours later I started to get a Panic attack , my heart would beat really fast and I thought I was going insane and dizzy. After that I had a feeling of derealization, not depersonalization that I did not feel like in my body, but that everything seemed weird strange, and in a fog almost dream like. I thought that this is what THC caused me to feel like (Never did it before). Next day I was fine but I found out my co-worker has passed away due to heroin overdose. Since then I had no symptomps of anything. Two months later, I started to get panic attacks and anxiety after my boyfriend’s fathers death. I had heart palapation, dizziness and lightheadeness. Once I found out that it was anxiety I learned to deal with it. However the derealization happened again once and made me feel like in a constant fog. Soon this went away as well but these intrusive thoughts won’t go away. Especially at night time where I think what if I am not really here, everything seems strange and weird around me. Not as much as that night that I took the syroup but sort of. IT’s just these thoughts are scaring me and make me think that I might be getting schizophrenia , or the onset of it…This is all I can think about, I try to go out and there are days where I have better days and seem happy and normal but then the worse days come too.

2453,5098,"My boyfriend has a school reunion event coming up next weekend. I’m not going because I didn’t go to his school. I grew up in another country and moved to the UK when I was 18, and met my bf soon after I moved to the uk. I felt very daunted by being with him as he was very popular at school and he still lived in the environment where all his school friends were and where he grew up, while I didn’t know a single person in the country. However, I have always been someone that makes friends easily, I never have any issue with anyone and generally I would say I’m pleasant person. But for some reason some of his school friends were not welcoming to me. perhaps I was seen as an outsider, (I’m European), or as someone a bit different. but me and him are very happy together. Over the years I’ve heard from some of his friends that they had “heard I was a horrible person and heard bad things about me from other people”, and the people were always people I’d never met, and it was just girls or bitchy people that my bf went to school with. I never understood it, but it really did hurt my feelings because as I said before I’m an open-minded and friendly person, and don’t think I’ve experienced people just randomly saying horrible things about me behind my back. we have a great friendship group with lots of his and my friends, and we all get on really well. however, I’m surprised and hurt that he would go to this event next weekend considering there will be people there that clearly have some strange vendetta against me that I can’t explain, nor do I know where it stems from. he says it shouldn’t matter to me, but it does.this is a big deal for me and I’m surprised he would walk over me like this. should I be hurt or just accept that he wants to go to this school reunion? he sees his friends all the time, so it’s not really a “reunion”. thank you (From the UK)","('understand', 'I', 'it')",understand,0,Supportive Actions,Magnification,
2454,5102,"I will try and be as brief as possible: 3.5 yrs ago I fell deeply in love with a man who is 13 years my senior. I had never felt this way and neither had he. We were together full time for 1.5 yrs however it was a long distance relationship taking up to 10 hours each way to see each other. We adored each other and wanted to make it work so made an effort to meet up every 2 weeks. The distance took its toll and when I felt ready to move in with him, he suddenly became very scared (his mum committed suicide 3 yrs before I met him and was quite abusive to him when he was a child) and took a step back which caused no end of heart ache. I knew he still loved me however it was simply impossible to continue as we were. Eventually the frustration of being apart caused us to separate. We decided to take a break- not to break up. But he went into denial and although we were in touch most days during the break, he said that he wanted to stay single. I was dying of heartache and 6 months after our so called break met another man who for the first few months became just a lovely friend, consoling me about my break and helping me, eventually the new chap and I started having a relationship although I had mentioned nothing to the first man (love of  my life) as in my head I thought he no longer wished to be together. After some time he found out and told me that he wanted to get back together by which time my trust had flown out the window. The new man was so lovely and kind and fun and all the rest of it but we lacked much sexual intimacy.

I was dying of heartache and 6 months after our so called break met another man who for the first few months became just a lovely friend, consoling me about my break and helping me, eventually the new chap and I started having a relationship although I had mentioned nothing to the first man (love of  my life) as in my head I thought he no longer wished to be together. After some time he found out and told me that he wanted to get back together by which time my trust had flown out the window. The new man was so lovely and kind and fun and all the rest of it but we lacked much sexual intimacy. Fast forward nearly 2 yrs and they are still both in my life, I am in love with both and both are in love with me. I live with the new one but I am dying inside being away from the first.  I have seen him and we both don’t understand what’s going on. Its so painful and I feel so guilty. Sex is still an issue with new man- I love him dearly rather than passionately. Help me please if you can. (From the UK)","('love', 'I', 'him')",love,1,Interpersonal Beliefs / Emotions,Magnification,

2459,5111," In the last three years I’ve been in therapy with two different psychologists for social anxiety. The fact is, I’ve noticed something’s wrong with me. I believe I may have BPD, because I’ve always had many problems with abandonment, instability of relationships and mood swings, and I also meet all the symptoms of the disorder(even substance abuse and self harm).I’ve always had a confuse sense of identity,I’ve never really known who I was, and experienced dissociation and depersonalisation since the age of 11. I identify as nonbinary even though I was born female, but I know this could be a consequence of BPD.My therapist doesn’t know about my condition because she just keeps asking me only about my anxiety and everytime I try to tell her something of the above she seems to not be even listening to me. I’m writing this because recently something changed.I’ve always had very different personalities depending from who I was with, but it’s been a while since I started losing connection with reality and I can’t tell what’s real anymore.I have nightmares and most of the days I don’t know if what I experience is real or not.I see the younger me as a weak, pathetic girl who knew nothing about anything but I don’t even remember how she was or what she liked. There’s this other part of me, though, called Chrissie. She’s a childish girl who is always cheerful and behave like a psycho,I can sense her voice in my head(not like an hallucynation, just an inner voice different from mine – sometimes we have conversations)that always suggests me to do impulsive things like beating the ones who treat me badly or saying mean things.There are days when something happens and I start to feel anxious, so she takes control and I start to act so differently that the people around me ask me if I’m high or something. Since Chrissie appeared I made some researches and learnt about DID. I’m very unsure about the amnesia that should incurr though, because I happen to be co-present when she takes control, but she does what she wants and I later feel like someone else has controlled my body even though I know what happened.When I dissociate while I’m writing something I can’t remember later what I was writing before, and I noticed I have very few memories of my life before my 14th birthday, but nothing more than this.","('like', 'she', 'what')",like,1,Interpersonal Beliefs / Emotions,Mind Reading,

2474,5129,"Hi, I am having a tough go in my marriage. We met when both of us were recovering from a breakup. My now husband was going through a divorce, and hindsight, he probably needed more time to “heal.” We moved in together after dating one year, and then married a year later. A few months before the wedding, I began to notice his irritability with me and his depression. We would fight and argue and never resolve. I felt that I couldn’t talk to him about anything, because he would get defensive and either not engage at all or get very angry. My husband has now started Zoloft (about 3 mos) and he sees a separate counselor. We went to a couple’s counselor for a year, and unfortunately, she thought it best to go to another therapist, being we weren’t getting anywhere and she thought we needed someone more “direct and a structured approach.” Last night, we started with another therapist who is focused on EFT. After the session, I brought something up at dinner, and my husband again got defensive and later angry. It’s easier to not “talk” to him at all. I am torn, being we have only been married for 7 months and the road seems very long. We are not getting our emotional, mental or physical needs met. Would you recommend a certain type of counselor? It’s overwhelming with who to pick. I don’t know if an EFT approach is best for directness and structured? Is it worth fighting for? Thank you for any advice and/or assistance with how to proceed.

I do go to therapy, but I think there’s something else wrong with me. I have overcome my eating disorder as well as my depression, suicidal thoughts, and my anxiety is much better, but something I thought was normal was just brought to my attention to my therapist. I hear voices. Nobody else hears them apparently. They’ve got names and I can tell which one’s talking. Pan and Jacen talk the most, but there’s Kiri and Winter and others. They are not me and they have distinct voices. Sometimes I feel like I’m being followed and this makes my heart race. Sometimes when I swing or walk on the sidewalk I feel like someone’s going to shoot me or fire an arrow into my back. It’s dumb, but I can’t help it. Sometimes I see strange things that aren’t there. I used to see a dragon in the downstairs bathroom as a kid and sometimes my vision goes white or static is in front of all of it. My sense of time is also pretty bad and I usually don’t know what’s real. I listen to music a lot to ground myself and block out the voices. Pan is annoying, but Jacen is scary. He’s listening now and I can see him smiling and my heart is thudding. I’m scared to talk about this with my therapist because I’m scared of what she might tell me.

I told him I had a severe form of Non-Verbal Learning Disability when I got diagnosed and that the reason I am somewhat okay socially is because my parents always over encouraged me to be social and one of my friends taught me how to talk to people “normally”(and I’d go to my parents with any social questions). He would tell me I seemed fine and I would tell him that part of it was my generalized anxiety making me stay more quiet and overthink and overthink until I figured out non-awkward or offensive things to say (esp. in a text). When I would bring this up, he would basically tell me to try harder because when we first dated (and I was on Abilify, an antipsychotic that actually can help autistics), I didn’t act so different. Also during the relationship, he told me that he laughed during gore scenes in movies and had obsessive urges to harm people, but drowned it out with stories he told himself and video games. Now that we are broken up and he treats the relationship as if it were my fault for it ending and makes me do all the work to get him to talk to me, we have parted ways completely, and too often I have urges to harm him, mainly to show him the pain he caused me and my cause other, and also because he is entering the military with confidential computer data access which scares me. I’m angry with myself for becoming like him, but he called me out of my mind once, and I had a psychiatrist that tried to convince me I was with practically no evidence. Granted I was histrionic in the relationship and easily anxious that he’d break up with me when we had a really intense text fight involving all caps. He also accused me more than once of cheating when I never once cheated. Never agreed to call me as my therapist suggested us do for my NVLD.

I told him I had a severe form of Non-Verbal Learning Disability when I got diagnosed and that the reason I am somewhat okay socially is because my parents always over encouraged me to be social and one of my friends taught me how to talk to people “normally”(and I’d go to my parents with any social questions). He would tell me I seemed fine and I would tell him that part of it was my generalized anxiety making me stay more quiet and overthink and overthink until I figured out non-awkward or offensive things to say (esp. in a text). When I would bring this up, he would basically tell me to try harder because when we first dated (and I was on Abilify, an antipsychotic that actually can help autistics), I didn’t act so different. Also during the relationship, he told me that he laughed during gore scenes in movies and had obsessive urges to harm people, but drowned it out with stories he told himself and video games. Now that we are broken up and he treats the relationship as if it were my fault for it ending and makes me do all the work to get him to talk to me, we have parted ways completely, and too often I have urges to harm him, mainly to show him the pain he caused me and my cause other, and also because he is entering the military with confidential computer data access which scares me. I’m angry with myself for becoming like him, but he called me out of my mind once, and I had a psychiatrist that tried to convince me I was with practically no evidence. Granted I was histrionic in the relationship and easily anxious that he’d break up with me when we had a really intense text fight involving all caps.

2509,5172,"My 16-year old sister is not the social type; she has very few friends and hates going out of the house. She stays in her room with the lights off for hours everyday and talks loudly to no one in the dark. I don’t exactly understand what she says but it’s never a normal conversation, just one or few words that she keeps repeating out loud. She has to stay in the dark; she hates it when anyone turns on the lights in her room. She is smart and talented but lately she has been doing horribly in school. She doesn’t even want to go to school anymore and never studies. We moved recently and now she shares a room with her twin sister so she leaves the room and goes to a dark isolated part of the house where she talks out loud to no one and hides in random spots. We are really concerned about her behavior. Nothing is wrong with our family, and it’s not about the moving because she has been doing the same before our move. We never asked her why she does that. I don’t know what to do or how to talk to her.","('hate', 'she', 'it')",hate,1,Interpersonal Beliefs / Emotions,No Distortion,
2510,5182,"In my final year of high school, I undertook a course load that was extremely high. This course load, in addition to the requirement of studying for numerous standardized tests / college admissions tests made me quite stressed in the first half of senior year. This eventually developed into a condition similar to depression (though not quite at that magnitude), and I began seeing a psychologist regularly. At the time I got really into the Beatles, and I found that listening to their music was a great coping strategy. Time went on and I gradually grew out of my slump, and actually got to enjoy the latter half of senior year. However, now, whenever I listen to the Beatles, or any other music I listened to near that gloomy time, I am flooded by bad memories and emotions that take a toll on my entire day, sometimes the entire week. I really don’t like this, as the Beatles is my favorite band and I would very much like to listen to them again happily.","('like', 'I', 'this')",like,1,Interpersonal Beliefs / Emotions,No Distortion,

2514,5184,I think I have BPD and major depression. When I’m in a good mood I tend to eat a lot and when this happens I don’t feel bad a t the moment but when I’m done I feel gross and just too big. I start overthinking about how I will gain weight if I can’t control myself and make plans on how long I’ll fast to loose weight. That’s when I become very depressed. I really hate gaining weight and I’m can’t stop thinking about it. The thing is that every time I start fasting I can’t complete the goal that I set and it makes me hate myself even more. I’m very sensitive to failing at things due to school and I feel like a disappointment to my family especially my mom. She obviously get’s angry and disappointed with me because I don’t want to eat. Sometimes I also feel like the only reason I’m still alive is her.

2526,5201,"My boyfriend and I have been “together” since August, but on and off since we broke up 3 times. He has these constant feelings of insecurity, self doubt, feeling the need to compete (he visited me after work and said he was better looking than any of the guys there, for example; and today he was upset that his best friend was poking me on Facebook, and it made my boyfriend insecure). He overthinks really bad, gets really stressed out and handles it the wrong way. Two weeks ago he got really stressed and asked if I wanted to break up. Of course not. He’s been cheated on and betrayed and he knows friends and family who have also been betrayed in the past, so I get that he will have trust issues, insecurity, maybe even a hint of jealousy (or a lot of it?), but I think he may need help. I’m not sure. I love him, and when he’s not being upset, we’re fine. But he gets upset a lot; today he said he wasn’t eating because he felt “down in the dumps”. That worries me because over a year ago he was dealing with something else, and stopped eating, and went to a mental hospital. He said that after taking antidepressants, he eventually felt better and he hasn’t dealt with that issue again. The issues in our relationship have to do with him; he always says it’s him, something he needs to deal with, etc. His insecurity, overthinking, self doubt, lack of confidence or trust in anyway, the way he views the world so negatively and always expects the worst possible outcome, etc. Today he said he wants a break. I highly doubt a week-long break will cure this; I don’t want to insult him, but I’m not sure how to say that I think this is something he probably needs to speak to a professional about, and not deal with on his own.

There is this girl that I have been “friends” with my whole life and I started being in love with her before I even knew what love was. Everyone keeps telling me that what I am going through is completely normal and lots of people go through it, I know this but the fact remains that I have been depressed for 5 years now because I know that she couldn’t care less about me. She calls me her friend but she told me she doesn’t want me in her life. I have recently told a handful of people how I feel and I wish I could take back every word I said. I told my best friend who now thinks I am ridiculous, I told my parents who repetitively tell me to just move on, and I told the love of my life how I feel about her and she said she couldn’t care less. This has ruined my friendship, my family, and my whole life. I am a good student that makes straight A’s but I can’t focus at school because I am up till 2:00 am crying myself to sleep. I don’t eat as much, I can’t sleep, and I have randomly placed emotional breakdowns. I love my parents but I don’t think they can help, I can’t even tell them all of how I feel because I know it will hurt them too much.

2536,5213,"I have almost always had minor visual hallucinations (dark figures, geometric patterns, stationary objects look like they’re moving) in the dark (nighttime, dark room, anywhere), deep troubles identifying whether a memory is from real life or a dream, and I get deja vu a few times a week. I did not until recently realize that these could be symptoms of something concerning developing even though the hallucinations always make me very frightened/paranoid. A few years ago auditory hallucinations (muted conversations, can’t distinguish any words) developed. I have never taken any illegal/prescription drugs that could cause hallucinations. Is this simply my adhd causing memory problems and getting bored, or should I be looking into something else? (I should also mention that I suspect that I have borderline personality disorder due to emotional neglect/abuse from my parents and suddenly 4 years ago all my friends (known them for 7+ years) abandoned me. I have little sense of identity, fear of abandonment, frequent and intense mood swings, and splitting on people. However my hallucinations and confused memories are not about any of the traumatic events so I think it is something separate.)","('abandon', 'friends', 'me')",abandon,1,Interpersonal Beliefs / Emotions,Overgeneralization,

He is the only one i talk to, excluding my mom. My dad was a drunk who destroyed our family. He died 5 weeks ago, and I was happy that he died. And i dont know why, but i fantasize about killing everyone i see, even animals, which i love. I fantasize about torturing them in the worst possible ways i can come up with, then slowly kill them while they watch me doing it. I don’t know if the thoughts have anything to do with schizophrenia, since i had those thoughts for a long time. All i want to know is how to control those thoughts, since i start feeling like someday i could do that without thinking, as an impulse.

Most of the time I feel numb – kind of like I’m outside of my own body watching myself do things. This happens a lot when I’m nervous (in any kind of social situation). I’m unhappy and I hate that because I don’t have anything to be unhappy about. I live a blessed life thank God. For that I am eternally grateful, I really am. My life hasn’t even been that hard – the hardest thing I’ve had to go through was just a big move and my crush (,his family) and my own family making fun of me. Its pathetic – extremely pathetic, I’m aware of that. If I could tell you what’s wrong with me I would, believe me, but even I don’t know that. There’s just this extremely unsettling feeling in the pit of my stomach that I just can’t shake. Not to mention this completely hopeless attitude to life that I can’t change.

2568,5251,"Hi I am having some trouble. This is very embarrassing and I can’t even talk to my therapist about this face to face because I feel weird about it. I know that this section of the website is for setting up consultations but I really need help. Ok so here I go: I have been diagnosed with OCD when I was young and have had it all. I havent masturbated in over 3 years and the reason is something that bothers me. I always feel like something changes in me when I did it whether I felt unsocial, different, or weird in any certain way. I have avoided it because I am scared that I will feel that way and go back on things that I have worked so hard to conquer. Ik it’s OCD and the correct thing to do is fight it by masturbating to conquer the fear but I just need assurance that that’s what I need to do. Please help me. Thanks so much.","('avoid', 'I', 'it')",avoid,0,Supportive Actions,Fortune-telling,

2586,5263,"I am a 25 year old woman and I feel very confused. For some time now, I have experiencing lesbian tendencies. I feel that I am “straight” and have a history of dating men. However, I have always had a problem with having an orgasm while having sex with a man and usually have to do it on my own, even during sex with a man. I find myself to be attracted to women, particularly those I see on TV. I even find myself searching for lesbians on web sites and I find I get extremely aroused when I come across lesbian pornography. I have talked to a girlfriend of mine who has the same feelings (she is also straight), even further than me. She does not believe that this means that we are lesbians and assures me that every girlfriend she has feels the same way about this attraction to women / lesbian pornography. I even fantasize about women when I am trying to get an orgasm with a man. I know I am attracted to men and I am not attracted to the everyday women I see and talk to everyday, only those “fantasy” type of women I see on TV and on pornographic websites. I don’t understand this as I have never even considered pursuing a sexual relationship with a woman. I have thought of experimenting with a woman sexually but would be too afraid or feel too dirty to do it. What is going on with me? Is this normal?","('understand', 'I', 'this')",understand,0,Supportive Actions,No Distortion,
2587,5264,"My husband and I are presently living with my mother in her house for the last 10 yrs. I have a brother that moved in with us 2.5 yrs ago. Years ago he had some sort of breakdown and moved in with my parents and stayed for 4 yrs. I found some odd things on his computers. He was on some sort of online site with animals portrayed as humans. A curvy woman’s body with a sexy fox female face. I also found a small lion cub (Simba) stuffed animal with a small circular hole under the tail that was hot glued around the circle so that one could see the stuffing inside. I am guessing he was using it as a sex toy. I told my mother she asked me to call the psychiatrist he was seeing. I did he told me to get him out of the house immediately. I told my mother and she had him leave. He was laid off 2.5 yrs ago I found evidence of the same sort of behavior. This time it was a small black panther with the same odd hole under the tail and glued around, also his screensaver had a picture of a sexy woman with a fox face. I see little foxes scattered around the room he stays in. Guessing it’s his female animal of choice. I never said anything to my mother she’s been ill so I kept quiet. Lately he and I don’t get along. We (husband and I) don’t trust him. We lock our doors even if we are only outside feeding the dogs. He always lies and has already stole from us but denies it. My mother says she can’t survive without him. Rather than looking for he decided to stay here and care for our mother. She could do more for herself but he waits on her hand and foot. We got into an argument and I told her we were going to have to move I can’t stand living with him. She doesn’t want me to leave. I would like to confront him but not sure how far to push this. He’s very passive aggressive. I know I should leave but really can’t afford to and my mother wants us to stay. She may not live much longer anyway. How do I survive in the mean time? He’s creepy.","('trust', 'We', 'him')",trust,0,Supportive Actions,Labeling,
2588,5265,"It took me a very long time to find a man with the intelligence, kindness, energy, talent, competence and intellectual confidence that I wanted. He is perfect in all ways but sexual, I know he loves me. He proves it every day in countless ways.For many years now, I have totally buried my sexuality. I have, in fact, denied myself and not let myself be who I am. I have felt bad for being so sexual. I would try to initiate and/or discuss sex but has left him feeling pressured, demeaned and somehow the need to feel that he needed to be changed. Now, he is stuck in his own self-awareness of all that he feels he is not. To other women he was something. To me… I thought he was something else, that’s all. As a result, we’ve been terribly unhappy. I feel I have been in the hellish grip of a major depression. This life we have created is untenable for both of us. He cannot give me the sex I want. I don’t know what he can give me anymore. I don’t yet know how much more I can do without. We have worked out so many things, our communication can’t be any stronger and yet continually fails us. I feel like it is my fault, my insecurities, my hidden pain, my lack of beauty or sexiness or my weight or any other such things. I need to reclaim myself again, letting my sexuality back out of storage. I have fallen into depression hating the very fact that I have to take full responsibility for satisfying my own sexual need.I feel rejected, unwanted and unworthy. I feel sexually abandoned. I feel trapped. I feel lesser of a human being when I have to masturbate. I feel even lesser of a human being to leave and choose sexual freedom over this relationship. I feel dismissed. I feel unimportant. I feel broken, unrepairable. I feel like I am mourning the little girl he helped me find again and now is gone, hidden, struck with the memories of why she went away to begin with. I feel that I have to worthy to leave. I have never felt worthy in my entire life. I wanted a home, he gave that. I wanted a place that I didn’t have to fear of having to start over again, ever and yet here I am. Fighting those thoughts and feelings again. I have tried to be sympathetic, adapting to his needs or lack thereof. I have tried to tell myself that I am ok without sexual intimacy. I have tried to give him the space and commitment and support that he needs. I feel like I have tried… and he has not.","('love', 'he', 'me')",love,1,Interpersonal Beliefs / Emotions,Personalization,Magnification
2589,5268,"I am reaching out to you as a desperate man, in a need for diagnosis and advice. My health insurance is shit and I still live with my parents who don’t really believe in mental illness and think that I simply have to focus on other things and that it will pass. I don’t have time. I don’t have the strength. I’m supposed to be graduating the next year. My family depends on me. This has to end. Please, help me. Help me now. I am a Caucasian man, eighteen. Never been diagnosed with a mental disorder. However, I would scare quite easily as a kid. Once, I even developed a brief fever due to stress. I also developed symptoms that I would later recognize as OCD and scrupulosity at the age of nine. It calmed down in my teen years. I was also bullied for a few years, but after moving to High school and fitting in I let that go. It all started out on November 14th this year. I swallowed a fishbone, and felt it stuck in my throat. I was really stressed out, I thought I was going to suffocate. I ate a lot of bread and drank a lot of water, but I never really felt it go down. I calmed down by the evening, and I slept quite well. The next morning, I watched a horror movie, then an episode of “Cold Case”. It didn’t really scare me or anything, but I felt… weird. Like I couldn’t concentrate. And, sometimes, I would feel dizzy. Like I was going to faint. But it calmed down by the afternoon. I had a big dinner and drank a lot of water. I woke up quite early the next morning, with a nausea. I could barely eat. I was on the verge of vomiting the whole time. I kept googling my symptoms, fearing that I have a stomach ulcer, or even an internal bleeding. I calmed down by the evening, but I woke up at around one am, feeling cold and legs trembling. I didn’t go to school on Monday, figured it was some sort of viral infection. But that night, I couldn’t sleep again. I did go to school, but at around three pm, I would feel like I was on the verge of fainting. Like a barely controlled panic attack. But then I would calm down. On Wednesday night, I fell asleep. But in the morning, nausea. I spent the whole day stressing over that. Since the symptoms didn’t pass, I got into my head, despite not being overly religious, that I must be demon posessed. That would really freak me out. I would calm down eventually, and realize how absurd those thoughts were, but when they would plague me, there was no room for reason. I barely had any apetite by that point. I gave my blood and urine up for testing. It all came back clean. The next week, my apetite has returned. But, at night, I would have horrible, violent nightmares. I would actually feel physical pain, despite sustaining no actual injuries, and wake up at around one or two am. I researched about a movie called “Jacob’s Ladder”, that reminded me of my situation. I watched a few clips and read a plot synopsis. It only freaked me out more. For the next few days, everything would remind me of violence and horror images. Nightmares continued. Then I came to think of one movie (not a horror movie) that freaked me out as a child, but I eventually got over it. I couldn’t stop thinking about it. I watched a few clips on YouTube and it freaked me out even more. Now every day I have that scene in my mind, feel like I was when I was a child, with that irrational gut feeling that I will see that being from the movie when I open the door, look into the mirror, etc. Even before that, I was afraid of reverting back to a child-like state, becoming a failure, etc. Anyway, right now, it’s like my body is wired. In the morning, I feel terrible, and only calm down by around five or six pm. I have that weird feeling, like I am a child again (back when everything was big and scary and I didn’t really understand how the world works), constantly stressing over the things I know are not rational. I can’t make positive associations anymore and I can barely study. Like my mind is, for no reason, afraid of those memories, so it keeps freezing up, and when it doesn’t, those stupid thoughts keep interrupting me. It is like a combination of anxiety, OCD, and the world’s creepiest deja vu. It’s like my mind is constantly on alert, and worrying about intrusive thoughts. I actually have headaches because of stress. I feel better when I dissect my fears and talk about them, and actually LABELING myself (anxiety, OCD), but soon after the thoughts return, and I feel terrible again. Then I think “what if there is no cure”, “what if I stay this way forever”, “why me”, or “what if there is some truth to this, since you are so afraid”, and I just hit rock bottom. To make matters worse, there’s been lots of exams lately and my family is going through some tense times. I can’t catch a break. I have tried: -meditating -masturbating -exercising -focusing on other things -eating candy -rationalizing my fears -drinking alcohol (not much) -writing about my issues -talking about my issues with my parents -drinking chamomile tea I don’t drink alchohol (except those two times), don’t smoke, don’t do drugs. Never suffered a concussion or a head trauma in my life. I recently took an online IQ test (I know those aren’t really reliable): it came back as between 105 and 120. I also only seem to have nightmares when I go to sleep late, but even when I don’t my dreams aren’t much better. I know that this isn’t a therapy session but I have told you everything I would have told you in person and my blood and urine results came back clean. Please, give me some advice.

Don’t touch me, don’t talk to me, don’t look at me- I know you’re thinking about me or talking about me. Leave me alone. I have myself screaming in my head SSSHH! I tell myself to shoosh all the time-out loud I don’t know why. I want to smash everything! I don’t desire a partner-How annoying!Anything sexual is absolutely repulsive! I just want to think. I often will ramble- what I want to say, what I think in my head, never comes out how I want it to- It never makes any sense I hate it! I don’t know if we are real. Are we actually real? Why? We’re so minuscule, why should I care? You are always being watched, even alone in my house I am being watched- Everyone knows, always assume. I scream at people in my head, but I would never actually do it..I think I would need quite a push. I don’t intend to have a very long life. why would I?","('hate', 'I', 'it')",hate,1,Interpersonal Beliefs / Emotions,Mind Reading,
2597,5275,"During the summer this year I began researching the debate between evolution and religion. That was the biggest mistake of my life. My research caused me to develop an anxiety about life and death. I feared that there’s nothing after this life. I wanted to know if there is an afterlife, and I eventually found what I was looking for. Being a scientific person, I can only believe something if it has good evidence to support it. Thankfully reincarnation fit that category. I learned about it and found immense peace with that belief. I was anxiety free until around the time of Thanksgiving.","('believe', 'I', 'something')",believe,1,Interpersonal Beliefs / Emotions,Magnification,
2598,5276,"Hello! I would say I’m very normal, and I’m happy to be alive. I am still young so I haven’t had any traumatic experience throughout my life. As soon as I’m alone with my mind I fantasizes about horrible things… It started when I was young, I always wanted to protect others, and fantasized about helping others to comfort myself. As I grew older, the discomfort of the people I would help grew larger. Nowadays, I think about people getting tortured and assaulted in every way you can imagine in order to get this better feeling of comforting someone in need. Even though I wouldn’t hurt innocent, I still think about those things at least 20 times a day. I feel so numb with my feelings, I can sympathize with others, but I don’t know how to empathize! I could easily kill people, and if I had the opportunity in an unrealistic world I certainly would. I’m smart though, so of course I never would. I feel like these feelings will grow away as I age…but it feels nice to finally write these feelings down. I don’t think you know how much I actually would like to do to others, and how it makes me smile at nights. It scares me, because I could never hurt my family or good friends, that makes me feel disgusted. Then I thought, a normal person would feel disgust for hurting anyone.

She is a smart, highly educated, 32 year old virgin that I hardly think has ever even kissed someone. Myself, I have been in many relationships but am currently single, 32 years old as well. My friend has been growing as a person a lot over the last year, and in August she came to me and said she´d started dating someone she met online. I was very supportive that she started online dating, and thrilled that she wanted to go out for drinks, buy shoes with high heals, and I encouraged more social behaviour. She dated this guy for a few weeks and it ended. Then, about 6 weeks ago she called me at 00.30 on a Thursday night, asking if she could come over because she had something to tell me. I got a bit stressed thinking it must be serious, because it was so late, and because it could not wait. She told me that when she started dating that online-guy they had sex. He was her first, and they were not in love. Then she told me that she liked it rough and he could not give her what she wanted. She had therefore joined a sadomasochistic sex society, went to an information meeting and now attends meetings and parties. This just after having sex for the first time a few weeks earlier. She told me she didn’t want to lie to me and wanted me to know what was going on, because we are so close and I know everything that is going on in her life. This particular night she came straight from a 45-year-old man she had had sex with. My friend and I have hardly ever talked about sex, I have even wondered that she might be a lesbian without knowing it herself yet. I was shocked to say the least. We live in a small city with 300 000 inhabitants, big enough to be anonymous, but still. I want her to experience love and sex, not sex as a mechanistic act. The days after her confession I felt confused and sad, kind of like I’m losing her. Now she has a complete new side to her life that I cant share with her, and she has met so many new people. People of all sorts with a variety of sex-interests, some living in polygamist relationships. A lot that is new to me, but I wish to be open-minded. One week after the breaking news she attended a party and met a guy wearing latex clothes. Lets call him Alan. They jumped straight into a relationship, and one week after they first met, Alan and his friend joined my friend and I at a cabin trip (because he was going to Kuala Lumpur in a few days for work). He was rude to me and I did not like his attitude. He seems very emotionally unstable (I have a PhD in neuroscience), and recently got out of a 6-year relationship, just 2 months prior. He kept talking about his ex and how she being mentally ill had ruined their relationship. Apparently this ex-girlfriend grew up in several foster homes and was sexually abused, married a 25-year-older man that she left – including the children because she was an unfit mother. Later on it was revealed that this old father had abused the children too, and she got the custody back. Then she met Alan. Alan is dominant and my best friend likes to be dominated, apparently. I cant help but think that Alan sort of “liked” being with a damaged woman that he could help and further dominate. I don’t know, but it bothers me how negatively he was talking about her. All matters have two sides. Now my friend talks about Alan constantly and is in love. She has already introduced him to her parents and some of our other friends. After only 5 weeks acquaintance. She really wants me to like him. However, I find it really hard to like him and her new lifestyle. I feel like I have lost her and that our friendship has changed forever. It makes me really sad, she has been such an important part of my life for so long. I feel like she has put a lot on me, the sex-club in itself will take some time to accept.

I am trying to be happy for her, but in a way I don’t want to. It’s quite possible that if I don’t like this new guy I will lose my best friend.

She is a smart, highly educated, 32 year old virgin that I hardly think has ever even kissed someone. Myself, I have been in many relationships but am currently single, 32 years old as well. My friend has been growing as a person a lot over the last year, and in August she came to me and said she´d started dating someone she met online. I was very supportive that she started online dating, and thrilled that she wanted to go out for drinks, buy shoes with high heals, and I encouraged more social behaviour. She dated this guy for a few weeks and it ended. Then, about 6 weeks ago she called me at 00.30 on a Thursday night, asking if she could come over because she had something to tell me. I got a bit stressed thinking it must be serious, because it was so late, and because it could not wait. She told me that when she started dating that online-guy they had sex. He was her first, and they were not in love. Then she told me that she liked it rough and he could not give her what she wanted. She had therefore joined a sadomasochistic sex society, went to an information meeting and now attends meetings and parties. This just after having sex for the first time a few weeks earlier. She told me she didn’t want to lie to me and wanted me to know what was going on, because we are so close and I know everything that is going on in her life. This particular night she came straight from a 45-year-old man she had had sex with. My friend and I have hardly ever talked about sex, I have even wondered that she might be a lesbian without knowing it herself yet. I was shocked to say the least.

I can’t explain it. The only thing close to this that I’ve been able to find in my studies is sociopathy or sadism. Neither of these seem to fit me though, because both conditions usually include having some kind of sexual need. Sociopaths typically excessively masturbate, whereas I never have.

2623,5299,"Basically, I’ve come in search of help with anger management. I was raised with very strict, religious, over protective parents who constantly had violent arguments, taught me to shut down my emotions and to not express my feelings (at least not in healthy ways), taught me that the world is a dangerous, untrustworthy place, and that I cannot trust anyone. As a result, I have grown up to be very nervous, very shy, unable to trust others, unable to express love easily, unable to deal with negative thoughts or emotions in a productive fashion, afraid to be independent in the world, and constantly feel like I can’t make something successful of myself. I wasn’t always like this. I remember in my early childhood that I loved to socialize, explore the world, learn, I had dreams that I honestly thought I could reach. I was more positive, hopeful, and optimistic. Now, I feel as though all I ever feel is anger. I’m so restless. I want to do something, have fun, grow up , stop being so shy, and improve as a person, but, I don’t know where to start. And with my parents not permitting me to go out on my own, or even express my feelings to them without them thinking I’m possessed or something, I feel trapped.I’m not a bad kid. I’m sure of that. I mess up here and there but I really try. Ask anyone. I’ve been obedient, respectful, polite, patient for as long as I can remember, but, lately, only with my parents, have I been lashing out at. Of course, not physically, but I have been getting more violent recently. I’ve gotten into the habit of breaking things around me when I’m angry and just screaming and crying. It’s scaring me. I don’t want to hurt anyone. My parents have done so much for me, and I know they have tried their best at raising me, but, I can’t help but blame them for how I turned out and feel angry at them. Maybe it’s my fault and I’m too ashamed to accept that so I take it out on them? I just need guidance. I need a plan, a place to start. I hate this feeling of cluelessness as it makes me feel breathless and trapped.

I was raised with very strict, religious, over protective parents who constantly had violent arguments, taught me to shut down my emotions and to not express my feelings (at least not in healthy ways), taught me that the world is a dangerous, untrustworthy place, and that I cannot trust anyone. As a result, I have grown up to be very nervous, very shy, unable to trust others, unable to express love easily, unable to deal with negative thoughts or emotions in a productive fashion, afraid to be independent in the world, and constantly feel like I can’t make something successful of myself. I wasn’t always like this. I remember in my early childhood that I loved to socialize, explore the world, learn, I had dreams that I honestly thought I could reach. I was more positive, hopeful, and optimistic. Now, I feel as though all I ever feel is anger. I’m so restless. I want to do something, have fun, grow up , stop being so shy, and improve as a person, but, I don’t know where to start. And with my parents not permitting me to go out on my own, or even express my feelings to them without them thinking I’m possessed or something, I feel trapped.I’m not a bad kid. I’m sure of that. I mess up here and there but I really try. Ask anyone. I’ve been obedient, respectful, polite, patient for as long as I can remember, but, lately, only with my parents, have I been lashing out at. Of course, not physically, but I have been getting more violent recently. I’ve gotten into the habit of breaking things around me when I’m angry and just screaming and crying. It’s scaring me. I don’t want to hurt anyone. My parents have done so much for me, and I know they have tried their best at raising me, but, I can’t help but blame them for how I turned out and feel angry at them. Maybe it’s my fault and I’m too ashamed to accept that so I take it out on them? I just need guidance. I need a plan, a place to start. I hate this feeling of cluelessness as it makes me feel breathless and trapped.

2626,5302,"For the past 6 years my father-in-law has been suffering from some kind of mental illness. He is now 90 years old and physically reasonably healthy for his age. His problem is that he seems to completely believe that he can’t do anything and that he is on the way out. Anything that we do to help him he is convinced is killing him. He will do nothing for himself and needs to be strongly encouraged to the point of pushing to do anything. By anything I mean eating, drinking, getting up, washing, going to the toilet, standing-up Etc. He will physically try to resist, shouts at the top of his voice “I can’t, I can’t”, makes all sort of totally illogical excuses etc. He won’t feed himself but although he shouts and says it’s killing him, he will open his mouth and take the food. He cannot make any decisions, doesn’t want to engage in conversation or talk to people. However with patience and when he is not being pushed to do anything he will answer questions, he will get involved in doing the crossword and will show some interest in the newspaper and TV. At these times it is clear that he has no loss of memory (over any time period) and is fully aware of what is going on. He is as good as anyone at the crossword and will make sensible comments about sport, current affairs etc. Even though he won’t get up himself to go to the toilet, occasionally during the night he will. In the past he has been prescribed different anti-depressants but these just made him a zombie without any benefit. We have tried seeing a psychiatrist but he was not willing to open up and could thus not make any progress. We are pretty much resigned to the fact that he is not going to get any better however there is always the worry; is there anything else we could do. Despite much searching I can’t seem to find any similar cases or clear explanations. The local mental health teams and even a private psychiatrist have been very unhelpful either saying “classical depression” before prescribing drugs or saying that its “one of those things, at his age if it wasn’t this it would be something else” (and that was 6 years ago). Any explanation, suggestions would be most welcome.","('open', 'he', 'mouth')",open,0,Supportive Actions,Fortune-telling,
2627,5305,"I never thought it was a issue until I hit a breaking point from my Internship meeting. I was told that I’m not processing things (as he pointed at his head) at that moment I felt like I was retarded. That’s where I began to see a pattern from my previous jobs and through life. I would make a lot of mistakes when I am being told to do something. I’m not nervous, or deaf. I can hear, but when people talk to me I block out/they seem like they mumble rather than talking so I block out. It is troublesome because I have to repeat people all the time, and when I do managers shout at me and I hold back my feelings until I finish my shift which have nightmares about. I feel like I’m slow when doing a task. However it does not makes sentence because I have good grades and do all my homework and yet I can’t do what is asked to be done. I came to the point were I had to confess to my employer and my school, that I have problem and don’t know what it is.

Even my family notice something was wrong with me when they talk to me because I always do the opposite of what they say. I always thought if I try harder it will be better, but with me my mistakes remind the same. To be honest my mind works differently when people talk to me I mix words up or numbers. I always have to solve what people say if I forget/block out, which makes them repeat themselves, I always compare myself with other girls and be like why can’t I get it like her, you know. As for right now, I am taking notes and writing what people say so I won’t get mix up, but sometimes that doesn’t work so I have show to them what I wrote down “what I think they said.” I cry a lot because this a problem that stops me from maturing and succeeding in my career.

Thinks her family, her morals and beliefs are ‘superior’ to mine but bends her ‘superior morals’ whenever needed to suit her convenience. 3. My wife has a similar personality. She will make a fuss out of something, call her mother and trigger her off (Eg; During my wedding reception, my parents got carried away greeting guests. My wife blamed my parents for ‘not offering her water on purpose’ – she did not even ask for it. She triggered her mother. Her mother asked me to ‘offer water to a thirsty woman even if I am not willing to feed my wife’. Both women soon got enraged.) 4. Shows dual behavior – first she is this soft ‘parent-of-an-abused-girl-god-believer’, transforms into a raging verbally abusive woman derogating me and my family, cursing death/dismemberment/etc. to my parents. Later, she absolutely denies all she said in her anger and swears on gods that she never lies – I am the liar. 4. Every time we try to speak about these issues, she ‘faints’. My wife says there is ‘no oxygen flowing to her brain’ and asks her father to violently shake her head while blaming me for what happened to her mother. She ‘regains consciousness’ after a few minutes. Opportunity to address problems lost. 5. Recently, she began exhibiting literal split personality. She went into a trance – some ‘god’ had entered her. She said my birth was flawed and that god has come here to save me, threatened my parents with curses and death and asked me to treat my wife well. She physically hits my wife when angry. 6. My wife is very similar – dual behavior – shows affection, romance, we live normally for a few days and then finds a random fault with a sudden mood swing and goes into a rage-crying-despair cycle. In her rage mode she is absolutely uncontrollable. She hits me physically, abuses me verbally, weeps and threatens to call the cops and book me for ‘dowry harassment’, degrades me in front of her mother, plays the victim and so on. 7. My in-laws seem to act mostly on impulse without thoughts about consequences. My wife and FIL both rigidly obey my MIL.","('blame', 'wife', 'parents')",blame,1,Interpersonal Beliefs / Emotions,Mind Reading,

2654,5330," It started recently when I was finishing up my sophomore year of high school. I began to become increasingly paranoid (I thought people were out to get me, and that people kept staring at me, even if I was alone), that people could hear my thoughts, and I kept feeling like there was some sort of presence near me, and/or following me. Not only that, but I would have the occasional auditory hallucination. I didn’t hear voices, but rather noises people make such as breathing (as if someone were right next to me)r when I was alone (happened twice), a snarl (also as if someone were right next to me), and an exhale (right next to me; alone) , however these are minor compared to the visual hallucinations. These occurred in the corner of my eye. I would see moving shadows, full blown people (I would see them moving, sand they would be extremely detailed, but when I looked back they were never there in the first place.[this occurred 3 times]), and sometimes pictures would look like they were moving or finishing an action. Some of my other visual hallucinations I could see directly such as a face at the top of a door (occurred once), and one time I was sitting in drivers Ed and my teacher was talking about bugs when all of the sudden I see two black dots swarming around her head like flies, but it didn’t last long until they flew behind her head and disappeared. Another time I was sitting in a car and I saw a fly, fly right up to my face, so I swatted at it, but I realized that there wasn’t actually a fly, because I couldn’t find it anywhere, neither did I hear the buzzing of its wings. Another instance is when I thought I saw a bug crawling down my arm, but I didn’t feel it, nor did I see it where it should have ended up. Another time u thought I saw a bug crawling across my wall, but again I didn’t see it where it was suppose to end up (on the ceiling; it was crawling up). Not only that but when I walked down the hallways of my school, they would appear to be crooked, and moving, causing me to walk funny. Then there is other stuff like my loss of motivation, emotion (not flat effect), I would miss letters when I wrote, I began talking to my inner voice as if it were real (it talked to me first), I now have a bad attention span, and it’s now fairly hard to get my point across because I’ll get tongue tied, plus my personal hygiene is not the best, and my memory (especially short term) seems to be increasingly getting worse. That last part could be due to my dysthymia, but it still doesn’t explain the rest of the things I’ve been experiencing. I never have and never will use drugs, and I don’t take any medications.

I have a lot of the same problems and struggles he went through, when I start to talk about University and how I’m stressed and worried about applying to my mom she just says “You’ll do fine.” Or “Don’t worry so much.” She doesn’t seem to really want to know how i’m doing or how i’m feeling. Whenever she gets mad about something, as well, I’m always the one she will scream at. I’ve gotten tired of it. If it’s not a big deal I’ll just take it, but sometimes I come home from school and I won’t be able to relax until I go to bed because she’ll start looking for fights and expects the most out of me. She treats me like a child and holds my siblings in favor (I feel), but expects me to act like an adult. If it’s a real problem I’ll stand up for myself and that’s when she’ll scream at me, my dad often gets involved because he knows I am not trying to pick fights with her, but I won’t take her disrespect if I have not done anything to deserve it. My siblings are never really yelled at. Anyways, sorry this is so long. I started to blurt out everything rather than stick with one issue.","('doubt', 'he', 'himself')",doubt,1,Interpersonal Beliefs / Emotions,Mind Reading,Overgeneralization
2669,5343,"My partner of many years had a childhood of abuse and abandonment. Eventually he was adopted and things improved to a degree. He’s never really dealt with his emotions about his past, although he is a sensitive guy and I know he has a lot of hurt inside him. He has instead chosen to repress and ignore these emotions. He moved across country, so his family is out of sight, out of mind. He will do anything to distract himself and not think about it. He definitely has shown signs of depression on and off over the years. I’ve suggested therapy to him before. It comes up perhaps once a year. He is extremely reluctant and he says has no desire to relive his terrible past. I’ve told him I understand that and that I think while therapy would be painful, I believe it would be worth it in the end. He’s extremely stubborn and pushing an issue will make him more likely to reject it, so I don’t bring this up often. My approach is to discuss it in a supportive manner, encourage help, not push it, leave it to germinate. It seems to have made him open up to the possibility of help. He has conceded in the past year that he might be depressed. We recently visited his adoptive parents. It had been 3-4 years since he had seen them, because they live back “home” and he’s been avoiding his past entirely. His foster father is very old and unwell. He put off seeing them as long as he could. I encouraged him to go visit, because the guilt at not going was evident and I knew he would have terrible regrets if his foster father died and he had not gone to see him in so long. I know he feels a lot of guilt for being so far from them, especially now they are old and unwell. He approached me today and stated he thinks he is depressed. I think this is a huge step for him to admit this. I want him to get the help he needs. I will of course, be supportive and will listen to anything he wants to talk about. I do strongly believe that therapy would be invaluable to him. How do I encourage this route without scaring him back into his shell?

2676,5346,"I’ve had chronic depression starting in childhood with an emotionally absent mother. I was recently diagnosed with PTSD/BPD by new therapist. Christmas marked the beginning of this debacle. which set up the disaster and now my BPD, etc is a Category 5 Tropical Storm. A CONTINENTAL DIVIDE now exists between my son and I has turned awakening my abandonment fears. His response is total silence (he refuses to investigate this new BPD thing) and has cut off any possibility to try to resolve this. Meanwhile ironically enough his abandonment of me over this is not imaginary. Left to my own devices I spend all my days since 1st of the year existing in a pattern of emotional turmoil I can’t take much longer. I alternate between feelings of inconsolable grief and abandonment into resentment and culminating in my anger exploding leaving horrible messages on his phone which increases the gap. If we had talked when this all began it would have never developed into the mega storm it is but now it has – he has made no effort to get insight into BPD – he has genuinely abandoned me. The anger eventually burns out leaving me numb then we start over again. Being ignored as though I don’t exist also fuels the flames. Suffice it to say that I don’t see a way out and I do not want to spend my life cycling between all these painful feelings. I want to be able to talk to him, acknowledge how a part of me knows the rage is wrong and help him understand the mechanics of BPD. But I cannot make him talk to me so he is never going to understand and I am doomed forever to the abandonment I feel. While he was supportive during 2 medial emergencies I experienced now I have to guess that because this alleged malady of mine is emotional he views it something i made up to to manipulate him. He’s withdrawn totally which only multiplies my feelings. Suddenly out ofere he’s gone. HOW DO I SURVIVE this? My warm/caring son is as cold as ice. He has no interest in what BPD is. My days consist of going thru the cycles over and over again, grief, hurt, anger, crying, numbness this is no way I want to live.

Every day, she leaves and comes back and something sets her off, during her episodes she thinks people are watching/talking to her on a voice machine and that they screw with her body… or that my grandparents put her on this voice machine… she also tends to blame me for random things and throws sharp knives away because she thinks my young brother is going to stab us in the middle of the night, when he is NOWHERE NEAR VIOLENT AT ALL, he’s only 3.

2694,5356,"So for a long time now I have suspected that I may have been sexually abused when I was a child. I always put the concerns to rest, but I am realizing now that I cannot ignore it anymore. As I am getting older I see that my behavior and feelings about intimacy and sex do not make sense to me. I feel very confused. I always feel threatened by men and constantly feel the need to have a guard up. I was always afraid of men when I was little, but at the same time there was this curiosity and I was known to be very flirtatious. It is hard to talk about but I have 2 polar feelings about sex and I always feel like an object rather than a person. The reason I suspect I may have been sexually abused as a child is because my memory keeps bringing me back to this journal that I had. I believe it was my first journal. I remember vividly what it looked like. I remember being extremely sad at the time when I would write in my journal. Throughout my life until I left to college I used journals as a way to express my feelings. I grew up in a home where my father was verbally/emotionally/ and somewhat physically abusive and I was not allowed to have a voice so I would put all my feelings and thoughts in my journals. The reason I bring up this journal is because my memory keeps going back to this page in the journal. It honestly disturbs me. I was a young child it could have been a joke but the drawing I drew in the journal was of a naked man. I was around 6 or 7 years old when I drew this. I drew the penis correctly. however I keep wondering how did I know what a penis looked like at that age? In addition the the drawing, I drew a line coming from tip of penis down to bottom of page and then the line became intense scribbles going in a circle looking like a puddle. I do not understand why my mind keeps taking me there. I want to find that journal but I cannot remember where it is. It just disappeared.","('abuse', 'I', 'child')",abuse,2,Relational Harm,Overgeneralization,

I have guilt about not moving to where she lives, to spend precious time with her, but I am law school here (went to law school because I thought it would cure depression) and have a good job also. In many ways, although my childhood was scary and violent, I wish I could be twelve again – maybe that way I wouldn’t have to face reality of aging and death. I had psychotherapy in my late 20s, early 30’s and was relatively okay til I got to mid 50s. I should also mention I take care of my younger sister who has fibromyalgia and who lives with me. Because of the pain she’s in, she can’t shop, cook, clean etc. so I do it all. I love her a lot, but this is draining and makes me angry at times. Not sure what to do.

I tried to lay next to my mom earlier (she realized I was having an anxiety attack and wanted to hold me), and she had her arm around me. Something in my head, not a voice but a feeling, told me she was going to dig her nails into my back and rip out my heart. I got up and ran into my room without saying anything. Also, whenever I’m outside or in public, when I hear someone laughing or talking I feel like they are making fun of me. I don’t trust anything. I put paper over all cameras on my all my devices.

MDD also issue and of late have been disengaging and broke sobriety last session Drinkin prior to session yet we did an anger excer. I felt some release also felt it could be dangerous to do alone. I requested add., appt. from therapist since i had been in crisis. She had asked me if I wanted a referral. I was asking for an add., appointment. I wrote to her via email which I never do. expressed my feeling that it sounded as if she was again questioning if she wanted to work w me. I feel that what I wrote was true but also express anger (depression frustration w progress ) even thu I understand I feel I am Now faced with therapist uncertainty since as she put it unsure what works for me and if she is not meeting my needs will refer out. This I feel is more of her issue over what I wrote along with my break in sobriety . Today, she was late and if she was running late in the past she w tex me as a curisity. When she arrived 10min late having no apology. Then she indicated she had 10min to finish up her lunch. After 15min waved her hand to proceed to her office. In procession she was in in an small area hidden out of site were the copier was I saw her and she said go on in. She came in shortly afterward and stated she was going to make a copy of the emails i sent to her this took yet another 5min. while in session I discussed up dates and my feeling of over the past several days and my feeling of progress. She also advised me we would review the emails i sent. She told me in no uncertain terms she would not give me any additional time until we come to some idea on how to work together. she cut the session short after her being late and gave an extra 15min wait time prior to visit. the entire interview was 35mins . She was finished even giving a honest attempt to discuss matters opened her door for me to leave turned her back on me she indicated she has scheduled me for the month of Sept., yet I have paid to be within a journal group which last thru sept. As I began to leave her office she also turned around to leave. I allowed her to understand that I felt her distaste of me and her attitute toward me requesting her to drop such . she reminded me that the session was over went into bath with door open turned around again with the same look of distaste on her face, she then smerked as she closed the door. Unfinished business and I feel termination is going to happen not that there is anyone else who will treatment me that specializing in tramua treatment to the extent that she has been and continues to train in. I again mentioned as I did in email has we walked down the hall if you do not want to treat me just say so. She and I have had diff in past just about a year ago when I called a break she took it as a termination. Yet accepted me back 3months later only to advise me of referrals both of which have been cited for breeches and disaplined with the Off., of Pro dis. she is aware of it . I fully understand that i wish to heal and i also respect her abilities however I feel again she is in decision making to terminate me. She knows me and I feel and expressed to her that this isnt just about me she did acknowledge it. As last week it was apparent she needed affirmation from me that the anger work was useful. But I informed her that I wa not sure if I would be able to do this excercise safely fearful i would get more sucked in and not be able to get out therefore lashing out on others . she understood that I believe as she eluded to affirm my decision as wise mind. I also stated yes and self awareness. Not acknowledged. she feels insulted and so do I I can get over it but she has again seems uninterested to treat even thu further appts scheduled. I asked her to lose her attitute toward me and that last wks session i felt became about her since she was not able to accept my affirmation of the theraptic session. I have been deeply depressed anger is real. I want to heal yet I do not have the reason to believe that she is willing. Now I want for next week to awaiting any if any discussion of our relationship which she has allowed me full understanding until we come to an agreement on what and how we work together are in place. I lack faith that she will to be resonable and I pushed her buttons apparently today. ended the session after 35min. What is ure thoughts. I feel her lack of desire to fully engage in any discussion. The facts of her rudeness toward me and yes I responded in rudeness and I regret it. She was willing to make a referal last week which confused me since I just wanted an additional appt. Games being Played on me? I just feel so defeated and vunerable as she what believe is in processes of searching for some other person to treat me. and I cannot will not begin again. I cannot. No resolve just hostility toward me and back at her.

But when im driving im always looking to see whos behind me and what they might be thinking and if theyre following me and ill go 40 in a 25 just to get away from someone and im overly suspicious something is up and theyre followng me or thinking bad things of me somehow.I also have depersonalization and derealization issues and when it gets bad i convince myself that the reality im trapped in doesnt matter anyways and that i should just focus on the reality i create for myself in my head. Im also more religious lately? Ive always been agnostic but now I love Jesus a lot and bought a crucifix to hang on my wall from a thrift shop which isnt an issue but im just worried because my grandpa and uncle were both schizophrenic and im 17 and these are supposed to be early warning signs but i dont want to jump to conclusions of course.

It started with a look of desire from a stranger and then all of a sudden after a decade of content marriage I felt withdrawn from my husband and confused about everything. For 3 months I tortured myself analyzing and questioning my life. I concluded I was resentful of my husband, who is a good man, for two reasons: his drinking problem that monopolized my twenties, and the lack of sex in our marriage (less than once annually). Previously neither of these were an issue for me but after the “look” I started feeling that I had missed out on my best years.","('miss', 'I', 'years')",miss,1,Interpersonal Beliefs / Emotions,No Distortion,

I am very jealous and insecure I have issues with accusing my boyfriend of cheating I want to trust him and I have been recently but I believe I feel like he needs to prove his loyalty first which is why I am so anxious and afraid. He is out and about and I feel like there is a burning when I look on his fb and see something to suspicious he says he loves me and only me but I can’t believe him. I am very emotional and clingy and he is stone cold seemingly and overly logical which makes me feel like r doesn’t really love me because when I want his comfort he just gives me some cold fact than make me feel reassured. He has something that he has gone through because he told me he can’t love me the way that would be to me much better than what I am getting now. But he will not open up. I don’t want to lose him and he is coming to see me…I am not sure now because we just had another issue most of out issue…my issues center around social media and I hate that about myself. I don’t like that he like pictures of semi naked which makes me feel ugly and unwanted because I don’t look like that and I hate when his friends text or comment thing because I don’t know them and their past with him. He cheated before and I have had a hard time trusting him since that but before that I was accusing him so I feel like I pushed him to it. Please help me I cannot live without this man and I love him with my heart. I am truly in love with him and I want us to work. I don’t want to push him away. I don’t want to hurt him. I don’t want to lose him am I the problem. What can I do to fix this because want to trust him but it is hard when I have not proof.

2729,5393,"I am a 12 year old who has not been diagnosed with any disorders. My problem: “intrusive” thoughts. These thoughts started like this: I felt guilty because I felt happiness when somebody died in a movie I was watching. I decided to test myself out by thinking of the most repulsive action ever and then then try to make myself tempted. The repulsive action was harming my mother. I was confident that I would have no urge to do it. I tried tempting myself by having my brain repeatedly cheer do it! I felt an enormous urge to do it, which stressed me out. Does this count as an intrusive thought? My worst problem is the urge to do it. This urge kept coming and coming. Sometimes I feel like I want to give into this urge. Sometimes I feel like I have to carry out these urges. Is this another part of intrusive thoughts? And if you don’t think this is an intrusive thought, could this urge be related to curiosity, desire for infame or maybe even psychosis? Could I be confusing the adrenaline I feel with the urges. These urges get stronger when I feel love for my mother. So my questions are, do these thoughts count as intrusive thoughts, and are these urges normal?","('relate', 'urge', 'curiosity')",relate,0,Supportive Actions,Personalization,

I cannot for the life of me give myself a particular disorder, but I appear to carry traits and symptoms of many, mainly depression-related disorders. A few of my friends think that seeing a therapist would be beneficial to me, and I have come to reluctantly agree. However, my problems are very quiet ones, and are usually buried beneath my louder “outside face” which does not clearly display any of my inner turmoil. This means that instead of it just being obvious to my mum that I need help, I’m faced with the terrifying task of confessing my feelings to her. My mum and I are not friends, she is my parent and I am her child. This doesn’t necessarily mean we’re not close, but it does mean I have never found it easy to open up to her like I would a close friend. I find it difficult to articulate my thoughts alone, but to explain it to her seems almost impossible. I’m not sure where to begin. I have no one else to turn to as my father is not included in my life, it is just me and her in our household and I don’t have any other adults I trust with this sort of thing.","('trust', 'I', 'sort')",trust,0,Supportive Actions,Overgeneralization,

Before all this began to happened however, she was an absolute ball of energy, and just a little bit before things started spiraling out of control she began to be getting isolated by her classmates so that started putting out her energetic spark. She began to become quiet and kept to herself besides her closest and only friend. It was the worse in middle school when her friend moved and nobody at all liked her.

She’s extremely selective of who she wants to befriend, gets scared easily and struggles when a person approaches her and starts a conversation.

I did not tell them because I was just seeing him and not asking them to engage in any form of relationship because I knew they would not want to. About two months ago they figured out that we had gone out of town for the night. They sent me terrible texts and threatened not to speak to me again if I didn’t not stop seeing him. I have continued to do things with him because we are so happy together. He seems to have truly changed. I understand that time will only tell. We are not getting married or even including them in the time we spend together. Neither of us remarried after we split up many years ago.

2762,5447,"My older brother was diagnosed with schizophrenia 10 years ago. Before his psychotic break, we were close. After he got sick, I moved away for college and never moved back to my home state. For almost a decade, he’d only communicate with me in person. He was afraid to use email or the telephone because he thought people were spying on him. We I did talk to him, depending on what meds he was taking, he might be talkative or might not speak at all. He’s not really in treatment. He sees a psychiatrist every 2 or 3 months and takes a long term injection. That’s all. Other than that he never leaves the house. Technically he’s been medicated for 10 years, never off antipsychotics, but his delusions are always a problem. He still believes that certain people have betrayed him and tried to ruin his life. So I can’t say he was ever recovered or stable. His psychiatrist is aware of his ongoing delusions. In the beginning I encouraged my parents to get him to see a psychologist or other therapist and work out a treatment plan. They said, “He doesn’t want to do that.” So it never happened. Now I’m not close with my brother. He’s missed much of what happened in my life over 10 years, including my wedding because he didn’t want to go out of the house. My parents are trying to get us talking more. They use group text or Facetime. At first it was strained, and a year later I feel like I just don’t like the guy anymore. I don’t like the way my brother acts now. He’s rude, pushy, arrogant. He’s always criticizing and belittling me. He tries to manipulate me into buying things for him online. He starts fights about politics that seem endless and he won’t ever let them go (and we all have the same politics, we’re all registered democrats, so I don’t even know how we manage to fight). He never asks me about my life, job, husband, hobbies, house, town, etc. When I talk to him about my life he changes the subject. He only likes to talk about his interests (movies, politics, music). If I talk to a friend I haven’t seen in 10 years, we catch up. My brother’s not interested in that. It feels really one-sided. There’s no give and take the relationship. I currently have health problems and my physician asked me to avoid stress. I just feel like it’s impossible to do that with his toxic tantrums once a week. But I don’t know how to tell my parents to just leave it alone, let us grow apart, we have nothing in common and just shouldn’t be talking.

I have two older siblings and neither of them ever did this so my mum was ready to bring me to the doctors but my dad thought it was just my age as well as an over active imagination. My older sister has aspergers syndrome so my mum feared the worst but when I was older (around 6-7) I got checked for this and like my other older sister, I was fine.

It never went away but was less frequent after around 10 years old however now I am 15 and for at least 6 months now it seems to have been becoming more and more frequent. I’m zoning out more and more and when I finally snap back into reality I’m not even sure how much time has passed, its kind of like being in a trance. Its not like it only happens when I’m bored, I can be doing something I really enjoy and then I just zone out. I’m also developing a strange liking for a little bubble I’m starting to create, which is totally separate from the zoning out as I actually feel conscious during it. I just go into a kind of ‘bubble’ and begin imagining different things, I find this really comforting but I’m concerned about how much I’m enjoying it, I could do it for hours on end and it feels so much better then real life.

2773,5461,"Hello, I need help. I have strong urges to torture people/animals and force them into a bloody death. Blood satisfies me, I find pleasure from leaving self-inflicted cuts on my skin. At first I thought I was just depressed but I don’t hurt myself for that reason, I hurt myself to see my blood. I like the way it looks and feels. But that’s not the only violent act I wish upon myself, I fantasize about being tortured, I want to die as a murder victim, I want my murderer to cut open my body, I want to see my insides. These strange fantasies scare me, I can’t stop myself from thinking this way. In my spare time I catch myself glaring at people, planning their gruesome murder and seeing how I’d get away with it. I physically want to kill someone but I mentally don’t. I’m not sure if this is making sense to you, because it doesn’t even make sense to me. The only thing stopping me from hurting others is getting my satisfaction from illegal videos online, on gruesome websites such as ‘bestgore.com’ and ‘liveleak’. On these websites, people upload either real-life murder videos that they have committed, or videos of gruesome things that they have seen. I am not disgusted by dead bodies, gore or blood. Instead, I wish to be in a situation involved with a lot of blood. I have two very close, childhood friends that know about this, but no one else knows. I’m afraid that one day I’ll be sent to a mental institution if I end up doing something horrible. Let’s backtrack a little. I grew up in an abusive family, i don’t want to get into that situation but it might have something to do with the way I’m feeling right now. Ever since I was a child I had always loved death and gore, I remember when I was young, I watched the movie ‘Titanic’. I was never interested in the romance, instead, I would skip ahead to the scene where the ship sank and the passengers froze to death.

At first I thought I was just depressed but I don’t hurt myself for that reason, I hurt myself to see my blood. I like the way it looks and feels. But that’s not the only violent act I wish upon myself, I fantasize about being tortured, I want to die as a murder victim, I want my murderer to cut open my body, I want to see my insides. These strange fantasies scare me, I can’t stop myself from thinking this way. In my spare time I catch myself glaring at people, planning their gruesome murder and seeing how I’d get away with it. I physically want to kill someone but I mentally don’t. I’m not sure if this is making sense to you, because it doesn’t even make sense to me. The only thing stopping me from hurting others is getting my satisfaction from illegal videos online, on gruesome websites such as ‘bestgore.com’ and ‘liveleak’. On these websites, people upload either real-life murder videos that they have committed, or videos of gruesome things that they have seen. I am not disgusted by dead bodies, gore or blood. Instead, I wish to be in a situation involved with a lot of blood. I have two very close, childhood friends that know about this, but no one else knows. I’m afraid that one day I’ll be sent to a mental institution if I end up doing something horrible. Let’s backtrack a little. I grew up in an abusive family, i don’t want to get into that situation but it might have something to do with the way I’m feeling right now.

After a couple of sessions–a little more than a year ago–the therapist told my father in front of my step-mother that she believes he has Aspergers.

I idealize a lot of things socially unacceptable, my only confidant said if I were to act or attempt such things they would have to turn me in. I have a hard time knowing whats real pr not, and if others are out to get me. Ive been suicidal n self mutilate my entire life, Ive almost lost it a few times. In 2013 I tried to seek help, I think I was suffering PTSD. After wanting me in group therapy I ran and never went back. I also have substance abuse problems, Im irrational and impulsive, and making common decisions is difficult. I shake constantly, always weak but sometimes feel invincible. I may be anemic but nothing confirms it. I sometimes see things that aren’t there but rarely. I dont like people by any means, nor do I have much empathy. To keep my relationships okay sometimes I fake or overly act certain emotions I know I should have. I crave power and glory, to a point it should be a concern, yet sometimes lack motivation? I know I have experienced depression on many,many occasions. There’s things I’d like to do but I know I never could. I’ve been anticipating a major breakdown for about 8 from suppression, hiding, and faking. Ive had a great deal of tragedies, sexual abuse, abandonment, various suicides. I saved a friend once as a teen, I cut myself fairly bad, but I succeeded in taking the box cutter away after he cut his wrists, throat, and tried to stab his stomach. It plays out in my dreams like I remember, when I awake many things I’ve suppressed flood my head. Overall though the things I want to do, the things I find acceptable etc. thats what is scaring me, also that I can’t remember things.. I guess all of it.

I didn’t think much of it until he gave her a ride home and let her stay at his house while she was locked out of hers. I know he wasn’t cheating because his mom and sister were in the kitchen with them, but this was the first time he didn’t let me know what was going on.

He wasn’t even honest with everything at first until I questioned why he had deleted their conversation from his phone and I saw the facetimes in his call log.

He knew he was supposed to be honest and never lie again, but he did it again about two weeks ago. He told me he was texting a friend of mine about their common interest in music and I was okay and happy he was honest.

I’ve always loved writing and reading, even when I was younger. Reading is certainly an addiction, while writing fills me with satisfaction. So I started creating the plot and organizing the story, because I wanted to do it perfectly. I started making summaries per chapter so that when I actually start to write, I know what goes on in the chapter. I was so pumped about it. I felt like this time, I was going to do it right.

2795,5487,"From Panama: It has been going for a while now, but I realized about a couple of weeks ago. It seems like a really bad habit, but now I’m not sure if it’s just a habit. I have a lot of interests. I like researching and finding out what I like, but that also happens to be a bad thing since when I find an interest and I decide to pursue it, after little time, I give up on it. I don’t know why, but I always seem to do it. It’s like I lose interest, or whatever motivation I had in the first place. For example, a couple of weeks ago I had decided to write a book. I’ve always loved writing and reading, even when I was younger. Reading is certainly an addiction, while writing fills me with satisfaction. So I started creating the plot and organizing the story, because I wanted to do it perfectly. I started making summaries per chapter so that when I actually start to write, I know what goes on in the chapter. I was so pumped about it. I felt like this time, I was going to do it right. Until a few days ago. The book was just by the half. I stopped logging in my computer. I stopped looking for words. I stopped having interest. I simply stopped wanting to write. And I know that it’s not writers block, because I knew what I had to write, I just didn’t want to. And I’m so annoyed about it, because I was telling myself at the beginning: “Don’t worry, you’ll totally make it through the end this time.” And once again, I’ve failed to complete it. And not just in writing, I also quit tap dancing, piano lessons, TV shows, you name it. And I’m disgusted by this because I want to finish stuff, but then I don’t. I’ve never been diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorders, but I’m pretty certain I have them. I’ve never checked myself because my parents have enough troubles on their own. I have also insulin resistance and tachycardia (they are aware), so I don’t want to trouble them with something as big as depression and anxiety that may just be all up in my head and possibly not be true.

This is my first shot in corporate world and since I am a survivor of repeated child sexual abuse, I have very low self esteem, trust and sharing issues I already am not sure if I will be able to survive in this cut throat world. So this happened on an official vacation. I used to think that my boss doesn’t like me at all. So when he started talking to me I was really happy. But then he asked me to accompany him to the beach.

To sum up 4 hours a day on average i spend in a “focused mode”. But after 1 week of having a rest i returned to the previous version of mine. During these 3 month i cried a lot, punched myself in a face, tried to die while doing sports. Time goes faster and my mental power is reducing. I forget things more often and sleep more.

To sum up 4 hours a day on average i spend in a “focused mode”. But after 1 week of having a rest i returned to the previous version of mine. During these 3 month i cried a lot, punched myself in a face, tried to die while doing sports. Time goes faster and my mental power is reducing. I forget things more often and sleep more. In the period from 8 to 16 years old my daddy used to punish me physically and was shouting at me probably everyday. I really want to switch but seems like i cant find an appropriate tool for it by myself.","('hate', 'i', 'this')",hate,1,Interpersonal Beliefs / Emotions,Overgeneralization,

I now would be in 11th grade. I quit school, trying for me GED soon. Waiting to hear if I get help for money soon. I no longer know what I want to do since I want to live a better life: Nice house, car or two, eating organic, have a social life, etc. I want to talk to girls make friends and am social but I like phobic. I don’t have much help from anyone. Currently live with my mom and brother but in an eyesore of a neighborhood, low-end public housing and have no vehicle or jobs. I also want to live more of a free life instead of working most of my days. I feel as if I need a plan because I feel lost. I’ve had therapists but never felt like I had true help, I don’t need medications I would benefit from a life coach most likely. I don’t know what career path I want to take. I know I want to be happy doing it, have a lot of free time to enjoy life, have enough money to have the life I want. Maybe I could have my own business but nothing really interests me. I don’t want to go to college all that much, I don’t have money as it is nor want any more debt than I already have. Since a young age I always wanted to be famous, but of course I have terrible anxiety and am not good at talking to people or being in front of crowds. I know there’s nothing to be afraid of but still get the fears. Also I’m stressed out with this but also with my mom who is a smoker and heavy soda drinker my father is doing some time and recovering from drug addiction. A lot of family is like this. I want my parents to be around awhile so I can afford to give them the life they never had or never gave my younger brother and me. My relationship with my brother and mother isn’t good either. I don’t have any friends or girlfriend.to sum it up I is very different than the rest of my generation and need guidance.

Last semester, I was having a hard time dealing with stress and loneliness and my own behavior started to scare me. Whenever I was alone –which was the case very often- I would keep talking to myself or singing. When I forced myself to stop, it just went on in my head and got really tiring. So I decided to go to the psychological consultation offered at my university. The first appointment was very helpful because I really needed someone to tell me whether I was going crazy. The psychologist told me it was my choice whether I wanted to come again or not, and we set an appointment for a month later. Back then, I thought it was a good idea to give myself the feeling that I was seeking help and also to feel a bit encouraged/“pressured” to follow his advice before the next time. Since I was no longer in that hysterical state, the second session felt a bit unnecessary. I don’t like it when I keep complaining to others (although very often I feel that I need to do so) and of course I admitted that I was feeling a lot better. Nonetheless, I agreed to have a third session another 2 months later, so that I wouldn’t be “all on my own” from then on. However, the thought keeps bothering me that I am just seeking attention. In fact, it makes me feel super-attention-seeking, just writing that. I used to be a good student at school, and now this kind of recognition is missing at the university. I keep involving myself in voluntary work, but the only reason it makes me happy is that it gives me acknowledgement from others.

2819,5514,"For the past two years I’ve been going to a therapist and have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety and situational depression. Although it’s been going on since I was about eleven at least, that’s when I had my first major panic attack. I’ve tried a number of anti-depressants to treat my depression and anxiety, but they either didn’t work or the side affects were to severe. So now she put me on a “life style change”, where I am supposed to sleep more and exercise. I don’t know what to do anymore. My depression and anxiety have been so bad in the last six months I nearly throw up every morning from stress. I cannot seem to get out of bed, the very thought of facing the world every day makes me cry and debate my life. Furthermore, I cannot seem to sleep more than 4 hours, even with the melitonin my doctor prescribed me. My sleep deprivation has caused me to go into hysterics from crying and to laughing more than a few times. I’ve lost all interest in any activities I used to do in the past four years. I once danced, I quite that too now. I feel so emotionally disconnected from everyone. My family and friends notice it as well. Usually they’ll make fun of me or show real concern. Furthermore I wish I didn’t have the two friends I have. It’s stressful, I never do anything with them no matter how much they want me to. I feel like I’ll either be a bother or I just don’t want to do anything. I used to be an A grade student, I’d overload myself with advanced classes, now I’ve failed out of three of them. I just don’t see the point anymore. I hate myself. I cannot function in any social situation and now I can’t even seem to do any simple task anymore. Not to mention my weight changes, I’d go from binge eating to nearly starving myself because I just wasn’t hungry any more. It was so extreme for a few months, my weight got to a high of 135 pounds to a low of 117. In a week I lost ten pounds. Quite frankly I don’t know what to do, I’ve used support sites and they don’t seem to help.

2820,5517,"I didn’t realize I was suffering from depression until many years into it. I finally went to a psychologist and psychiatrist when my life was falling apart. I felt awful and had felt awful for a very long time, but after getting on medications and feeling like a normal, happy person for a couple years, it all felt like an old unreal dream. So I decided to stop my medications. My doctors advised me against it, saying that if I had suffered more than 3 episodes, I should stay on medication indefinitely, but I had never “counted” my episodes. Really, it just felt like I was born with one long and nasty episode. I have been off my meds for a month now and I feel horrible. My anxiety is so bad that my whole body hurts from being so tense and shaky. I’m missing work either because I’m too busy crying or I just don’t want to deal with life. I feel lonely, sad, and hopeless. I feel like I am cursed for life. From what I have read and heard, depression occurs in episodes. But I feel like I am doomed to feel like this forever, having no respite unless I take high doses of medications. Is it possible that I just have a “lifetime long episode”? I only went to see a psychiatrist when I was 22, about a year after I moved out of my parents house. My parents are deniers of mental illness – the have a “pick yourself up by your bootstraps” / “you can’t possibly have depression” attitudes, so I always attributed my poor mental status to a character flaw. But when I reflect on my childhood and adolescence, I don’t ever remember being happy. I think I was always depressed. I cannot possibly live my life feeling this depressed but I don’t want to take medication for the rest of my life either. I haven’t even mentioned that my medications and behavioral therapies have done absolutely nothing to help my OCD. That I have heard can last a lifetime. I don’t think I can live like this. It’s getting to be too much. It can all be tolerated until you realize that, for the rest of your existence, none of this will go away.","('miss', 'I', 'work')",miss,1,Interpersonal Beliefs / Emotions,Fortune-telling,Overgeneralization

2824,5526,"From Albania: Hello and thank you for reading this. Last July, my brother got married to the love of his life. They had been together for 10 years (since he was 20 and she 19), lived together for 2. She was the first and only girl he ever dated and was completely committed to raising a family with her. In November his wife started a new job, and in March this year she left him. He is completely devastated. When it happened, he cut off all relationships and we were not able to see or talk to him for a whole month. At that time he was still hoping that she would go back to him, and was waiting for her at their home. When it became clear that she wouldn’t come back, he moved back home with the family. For 2 weeks, he would just lay in bed staring at the ceiling, and couldn’t sleep at night. My mother and I stayed close to him and whenever he wanted to, we would talk and discuss what had happened with him. At least he started to go to work. He is a very introverted person, and he had invested so much in that relationship at the expense of other relationships in his life. He has very few friends and he is not really close to family members. It seemed that things got a bit better. He started going out at times, and he started sleeping again. It has been 3 months since, but he is not capable of moving on. He has shut down again, doesn’t want to talk to us, doesn’t go out, has no interest on anything. We are trying to convince him to see a psychologist, but he won’t go. He feels that his life has no meaning any more and he feels like he is suffocating in this life. He thinks now, that the only solution would be to move to some other country and start a new life. How can we help him? What else can we do to make him see that there is still life ahead? What can we say to him? Thank you in advance.","('help', 'we', 'him')",help,0,Supportive Actions,No Distortion,

2871,5594,"The question is relating to my father. He moved abroad for work when I was 12 and we have had very little communication since (approx. 4 visits home in the last 20 years and the occasional email or text) I have long accepted that this is just the way he is and feel OK with the situation, however, after having children myself, I do not understand how he could be OK with not seeing us, knowing his grandchildren etc. What I do know is that at 11 his mum left his dad and him and his sister (1960) to go off with another man, which apparently she did frequently. This particular time in 1960 after she left his father felt he couldn’t cope with the children, and hoping to make his wife return, he put them into care. Apparently they were in care a while, as it was hard to get them out back then once put into care. My mum told me that he never really forgave his parents for doing this and even though he had a relationship with them.

I start shaking, and my heartbeat is going crazy. The next thing I know, I’m seeing things. Like, dreaming, but not. I can still feel my body, and I’m not all the way asleep, and I can kind of see shapes and impressions of things but it’s all made up of black. There’s no color to it. It all feels very real, and all of a sudden, as I’m trying to pick up a box in this not-dream, I can’t lift it. It isn’t that the box is heavy, it’s that my arms just won’t lift! I can just feel my heart going faster and faster, and my entire body is almost buzzing. I open my eyes, shaking, and my arms feel like they’ve been straining at something for hours. I have to roll over and curl up against the wall because my body is still freaking out. The entire thing lasted about half an hour. What the heck just happened to me?? All I know is that my arms and shoulders are still tensed an hour later (not like constantly, but I definitely feel like they’re still trying to tense all the time), and my heart is still not back to normal yet.","('open', 'I', 'eyes')",open,0,Supportive Actions,No Distortion,
2875,5603," I don’t know the best way to explain myself so please bear with me. I tend to have a lot of issues going on in my head. First of all I don’t feel like I think, or have the capacity to think like a normal person. I tend to get different ideas or incorrect information from what people are explaining to me, or it just takes me a long time to process the information that is given to me. This causes me to come off as stupid, or makes me seem that I don’t care. Another thing is I take my transgressions toward others very seriously, when I feel like I’ve don’t something wrong, or let someone down I really take it to heart because I don’t want to be the cause of someone’s disappointment. I feel this is the right thing to do, but I always feel like I’ve don’t something wrong when I express this to my friends or co-workers. Growing up I always felt like I was an intelligent person. I never really thought like a child and was always more aware of myself and how my actions affected those around me than most other children. I love learning, but can’t seem to understand what people are saying to me. I’ve always had this inner monologue that is either pushing me to do something I don’t want to do, or just telling me negative things about myself. I’ve actually caught myself sometimes arguing out loud with this voice. It was me speaking the whole time, but in two different tones. Also I tend to see really horrible images in my head. For example if I see a plane flying by I’ll see it blowing up right in front of my eyes. Or if I’m see a person walking down the street I’ll see them getting hit by a car. I don’t want these things to happen and it really upsets me when I see them to the point where I’ll sometimes start crying. Right now I just had something happen at work that I feel terrible about and it affected everyone in the building. All I keep seeing is me running and jumping out the open window in the office before anyone could stop me. I wouldn’t do it, but I keep feeling this way. These things cause many problems all of my relationships. Any Advice?","('love', 'I', 'learning')",love,1,Interpersonal Beliefs / Emotions,Personalization,

The very moment that I wake up I start talking, imagining situations, which might never arise or practice what to say at uni today. I have a horrible habit of pulling my lip skin, scratching my head and anywhere where there is dryness, to the extent it bleeds sometimes. I have also called in sick to avoid uni or exams. I enjoy being with people and fell lonely once I am home. I have a younger brother and am always terrified to the extent that I have cried for his safety. I am overprotective about him.

2894,5617," I’m obese but told that I’m not. My moods change based on how people treat or what they say to me. I get annoyed easily. I’m empathetic but act like I don’t know anything. Everything I try to succeed in I fail because I’m not good enough. I waste so much money on beauty supplies but fight the knowledge that it’s just society. I pick zits to the extent of scarring because I can’t stand anything raised on my skin. I’m an INFJ and Pisces. I watch how people judge me and it makes me regret being unique (I try to be different but within reason to what I like in general.) I often wonder why I don’t fit into this world and if there’s another but know deep inside there probably isn’t and I’m wasting time acting like this but can’t help but think of all the wonders. I always have hope for the best but never find it. All of my friends just stop talking to me and always place me on the back burner because they know I’m always there when they need me. I feel overwhelmed with life. Depression medication always makes me gain massive weight (20lbs in a month) so I don’t take them and anxiety meds won’t be prescribed because of the drug issues within our community to someone who looks like I do (tattoo’s in a rural area.) I feel like I’m supposed to do something great but I don’t know what that is and feel like I won’t know until it’s too late. I must have everything clean and in its spot at all times or I get super frustrated and lose my temper. I focus so much that I lose the concept of anything. I have around 10 major crying fits a year as said from my husband. I don’t feel attractive after having our children in 2012, 2013. I don’t feel successful, everything that is mine has gone to shit and I’ve lost a sense of self. I’m confused by the world and would like to stay tucked away in a forest with a huge fence around the area. Doctors act like they know right what it is “depression” or have no idea but would like me to ‘try’ said medication to see if it helps and it never does. What is wrong with me?!!!!","('like', 'I', 'what')",like,1,Interpersonal Beliefs / Emotions,Labeling,All-or-nothing thinking
2895,5619,"I recently ended a 3 year relationship with someone who I’ve realized was emotionally abusive. I started wondering if I was being abused about a year ago, and recently read an article on this website that seemed to detail exactly how I feel and how I was treated. The title of this article is ‘Emotional Abuse and the Impact of Absence.’ He would withdraw without telling me what was wrong, leaving me to guess. He would rarely apologize, and seemed to be emotionally unavailable. Sometimes his withdrawal was due to me being upset about something that had nothing to do with him. He was extremely critical of my children, and my family. He found fault in the way my kids walked too loud, held their fork wrong, a look on their face he didn’t like, etc. and claimed that it wasn’t their behavior that was the problem, but my lack of disciplining them for it. However, it seemed no matter how I responded, he would find fault with it, and I felt like I was walking on eggshells when he was around because I never knew what would irritate him next.  In the past, I have tried to tell him how his actions made me feel, and how it affected me, but he responded with defensiveness and I ended up feeling worse, like everything was my fault. I felt like I was accepting any crumb of affection or attention from him even though I knew I wasn’t being treated right. I quit trying to talk to him about my hurt feelings because I feared it would just make him withdraw more, and possibly end the relationship. I’ve told him the situation was emotionally unhealthy for me, but I never confronted him about his actions being emotionally abusive. Now that the relationship has ended, I’m still struggling with all the hurtful things he did, and can’t seem to get past it. Should I confront him and tell him I think he was emotionally abusive and why? I’m afraid if I do, he’ll respond negatively and I’ll end up feeling worse, and if I don’t, it will continue to eat away at me, and I’ll regret not standing up for myself.

2896,5621,"I live at home with my sister and parents. My sister never leaves the house and doesn’t ever visit any friends, although there are people who care about her and often ask me how she is doing. Basically she’s at home 24/7. She sleeps a lot and is sad often. She doesn’t answer text messages from anybody, not friends or even family. I have spoken to her because I am concerned about her mental health, and she knows she is sick. She thinks that she has depression, as well as a disorder somewhere between social anxiety and avoidant personality disorder. But she just won’t see a doctor. I have set up appointments for her only to fail in getting her to go- she just refuses and makes up an excuse like ‘I’m feeling tired’ or ‘I’m busy’. The few times she has set up appointments have been the same- she just doesn’t go. When she’s physically sick she will go, but won’t tell the doctor about her mental health because she feels embarrassed and awkward to tell a stranger about it. I can’t afford to have a doctor come to her, and neither can my parents. Even my parents don’t seem that concerned about her, they just complain that she has no job, even though that’s the least of the problems and a mere symptom of her mental health issues. I just don’t know what to do. It’s also hard because she seems to be dependent on me as I’m the only social contact she really has.

I also suffer from social anxiety on a smaller level, and it’s stressful to wonder what people might be thinking, if they notice her dependency and us both being anxious, and because of this, I prefer going alone.

The more I talked to him the more signs of being a psychopath began to show. He claimed he had no remorse for hurting people. And he said calmly that he thought another kid was going to beat him up (A kid who I know personally would never do anything like that) and so he said he had to kill him. That kind of scared me but I made no comment in an attempt to not discourage him from talking to me.

2918,5634," I have been dating my boyfriend for about 1 year now. I moved from Arizona to Colorado to be with him. HE was living with his Mom and so I moved in as well. He paid her rent for his room and he did things for her around the house. When I moved in she also charged me for rent for sharing HIS Room. At first we got along but as time went on I began to notice things. She would constantly text him while we were just in the room next to her, she would constantly yell out his name for him to come… and just ask things of him. HE isn’t working as he is on disability and had been in jail. Well soon he got into some trouble again and his mom called the police on him and my mom and I had to bail him out ..his mom wouldn’t and sat around saying how glad she was he in jail. Now that he is out she is back to the same..this time we don’t live there but she is always asking him to do this and that and talking badly of me. They text constantly and even sometimes when he and I are talking he will text her. and it’s weird stuff..like how handsome her son is and calls him her baby and sends him emoji’s like sunshines and things. I find it strange how he is always needing to go see her and will find any excuse to do so. While he was living with her he gave her all his money and she gave it out to him accordingly., I came along and I pointed out how he needs to be independent.. he is 48 years old!!!! so he did listen to me on that. But I can’t seem to understand this relationship with his mom. She isn’t very good to him and he is allows her to be so disrespectful to me.

2920,5635,"From the U.S.: I’m trying to determine the name of what I have so I can research it. Whenever I become romantically involved with a person, the more I trust them, open up to them, feel nurtured by them, and generally as I become emotionally close to them, the less aroused I become by them. I eventually lose any instinct to segue to sexual activity and instead prefer emotional comfort and intimacy. This does not exclude a desire for sexual activity altogether, because I still seek it while losing my ability to see the trusted partner as a viable option.","('trust', 'I', 'them')",trust,0,Supportive Actions,Should statements,
2921,5638," Hi..in the past, I’d say about 2 years, on and off again I experience drastic mood swings that can cause me to feel empowered and ambitious, or empty and dead. However they are not spontaneous..usually (90% or more of the time) they are caused by me being paranoid and possessive of my boyfriend. I trust him and he has never done anything to make me feel otherwise; but I still feel like I can’t let my guard down. For example, I could go from being in an ecstatic mood and be on top of the world and a chick could talk to him about homework or how to contact him ; anything and I’d automatically get in a rut. On top of this, I feel like I consistently need to be paid attention to by people close to me, but I hate being in the spotlight! I like being alone most of the time and prefer everyone to keep their distance from me yet I feel like I need some sort of praise from him, my family, my *close* friends. It’s getting kind of hard to deal with because when I get in the “empty” state of mind I feel unmotivated and end up neglecting school work, chores, activities, everything. I feel like it is not worth the trouble of dealing with and this just drives me deeper in since the lack of work ethic makes the future even harder to deal with. I constantly worry of the future and these mood swings are messing with my life. I just want something to go by – some advice for what could even kind of help. Anything. Even a new diet or something..Just..I just want to get out of this hole but I feel like it’s impossible. Please help me .

I’m not saying I’m perfect but I was a child of obedience, good grades, never swore, just desperately wanted to please my parents to no end, you get the picture. When I was a teenager she was physically and emotionally abusive with me, she went through a bad divorce with my dad and the death of her mother and sister so she did take it out on us, more so me and dealing with bulimia.  My mom does depend on me now for rides to work because she lost her license and does have type 1 diabetes so I’m the one responsible for her even though I want to move out and begin my life with my 7 year boyfriend. My mom doesn’t approve of us living together so I am afraid she will end our mother daughter relationship because she’s threatened it before. To this day she treats me horribly compared to my brother and sister even though I try hard not to start fights with her, I’m very quiet and passive which I guess she hates? And she walks all over me if my sister refuses to do something for my mom. Whenever I have tried to tell her how I feel she manipulates me into thinking something is wrong with me, she also seems to have a narcissistic personality problem but I’m not going to diagnose her. How can I begin my life without starting a war. An example that happened is that I expressed excitement over my future home that I offered that she can help decorate, she refused and said if I moved out she would never come over or talk to me but when my brother expressed wanting to move out she offered to pay his rent.

He is 17, and lives with his parents currently, and they come from a very low income family. When I go over to his house, his father is always drunk, yelling at the tv or his granddaughter in profane language. His mother has never shown an ounce of intrest in him when im there, and has not even bothered to enroll him back into highschool after he was expelled when a student attacked him. He has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and ADHD, and was on pills for sometime, but his parents took him off for some reason…..They dont have health insurance for him, and he hasn’t been to a doctor in over 2 years. It has gotten to the point where he is going to ask his grandmother if she can take him to the doctor. He also has this randomly recurring, excruciating pain in his ribs every so often,lasting anywhere from a minute to several hours. since he was a child and no doctor could diagnose it. i think it may be all the extreme stress…He went through tremendous physical abuse at a younger age, and constant moving from home to home. I want to help him get past this and heal his emotional wounds so he can make a great life for himself. Last night he was going through a really rough time, and actually scared me with what he expressed about his feelings. He has no other family members, in town, other than his two adult sisters that moved into an apartment together 10 minutes away…. however he cannot stay there because they recently had a baby and the boyfriend is living with them. his parents continuously put him down and tell him how worthless he is, and how they’re kicking him out the second he turns 18. He says he just wants parents who ask how you’re feeling, say i love you and how your day was… but he has never had that. he comes home to drinking and smoking and screaming. This past week he has started his first job, working for a contracting company doing under the table work like hanging dry wall and packing mud, he is really exited to be making money and i want to help him figure out a savings plan so he can move out when he turns 18. im sorry this is so long, i just wanted to tell you the whole situation, and i just want someone to give me some advise on how to help him move on from his parents and love himself. It tears me apart to see him go through this, and know this is all hes ever known.","('love', 'i', 'you')",love,1,Interpersonal Beliefs / Emotions,No Distortion,

I realize we had a serious lack of communication, and that I was trying to get his love back by fighting and making him feel bad so he would love me more. That logic makes no sense, I know. I feel incredibly sorry about everything I have done to push him away in the relationship. We moved in together for our first year of university and that is when things started to go down.

He spends most of his time alone, but his grades are fine.

Girls do not hang out with him, but with many of the richer more popular boys, they like. He used to love doing a lot of things that he does not find enjoyment in anymore, and he doesn’t play sports.

I’m scared to report this and I hope that this can stay anonymous until something major actually happens. Which I don’t think he is capable of doing but is so then ill make the call.

At the time I honestly believed it would go away however it has only gotten much worse over the past three years. Last year was a hard year for my entire family including death, divorce, and my sister’s diagnosis with a psychosis. Even before her time in the mental hospital, my parent’s drinking had gotten far out of hand and my mom was gambling more than ever.

I’ve researched a lot of different mental disorders and I can relate to a lot of the symptoms of so many of them. When I was in 4th grade I was diagnosed with ADD and I’ve have had on and off depression, disordered eating habits, and anxiety since then but I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety 3 months ago. Lately I have been feeling very disconnected and can’t stop zoning out, when I’m not zoned out my vision is distorted. Everything looks like its shifting, breathing, certain things pop out a lot, and when I read text it waves and spirals into itself. Sometimes when I walk I feel the curve of the earth and everything to the side of me looks downhill. Kind of like tripping but not. I did do LSD twice about 5 months ago but I’ve only been experiencing these symptoms for 2 or 3 months so it’s not because of the acid. I question reality and get confused about the concept of time and sometimes I completely forget who I am. Also been having bad insomnia and strange sleep patterns. I’ve been impulsive and doing things that I regret later; smoking a lot more than usual, drinking all the time and trying other harder drugs like Xanax and coke(once) but thats weird for me because I’ve always thought of myself as weed only.

About a year into our relationship I had to take a break from it because I had a history of violent sexual abuse that I had to get help for and our relationship was hard for me to participate in during that time. About 3 months into our break we started going out on dates and working toward getting back to normal, but we were not officially together. During this time of dating and him pursuing me he had sex with another girl. 3 years passed and he never told me about the incident — since that happened we had moved in together and he asked me to marry him. I recently found out about the sex because he left his email logged on to my computer and he was emailing her an apology for his poor behavior with her. This is the first time he has been physical with another girl, but during other parts of our relationship I have caught him sexting his ex and at one point I found him texting one of his peers at school telling her that he didn’t get enough attention from me and he wanted to kiss her and see if she was the thing missing from his life. I don’t know how to proceed with him. I love him very much and our wedding is in 2 years but I’m not sure after all of this if it is even worth the work it will be to fix our relationship.

I was able and strong enough to find a professional job that could support us, but it was out of state. She at this time proposed we marry and have a long distance marriage. The last 3 years we have been living back together and she has worked at 2 different hospitals.

My family has had a history of mental illness/disorders, my grandmother suffered from sociopathy and we believe that her mother was schizoid. Recently, I have begun thinking that something is wrong with me, too. I’ve tried to recall moments in my life when I have shown what some people call “concerning” traits/perspectives and there has been a lot. I seem to prey on people who are “helpless,” people who need shoulders to cry on and once I have their trust, I turn on them. I have contemplated suicide, but not because I was depressed but because my life is routine and routine is boring and being bored is probably one of the worst feelings. I have been in trouble quite a lot during primary school and the start of secondary, due to my attitude to the imbeciles in my class- I always say snide things about them and I have found myself trying to provoke a fight, which makes no sense because it is not logical because they are nothing to me and any retort they make to my arguments simply wouldn’t be worth listening to- it would be like listening to a newborn try to come up with a valid argument.","('forgive', 'Greetings', 'me')",forgive,1,Interpersonal Beliefs / Emotions,Mental filter,

2989,5722,"Hi. I have a history of having a relatively short temper, normally this is just shouting or nothing serious. But occasionally when I get angry I lash out physically, so I’ll hit walls or pull on my hair but I’ve never hurt anyone and it’s always been in private so no one knows this has been happening. About a month ago my girlfriend told me something that made me angry. I could feel myself getting angry and started to pace around her room, she could she I was distressed and got up to comfort me but in that moment I needed space so I pushed her away onto her bed. She wasn’t hurt she was just shocked. I hadn’t even realised I’d done it. Anyway I calmed down in the end and we’ve carried on as normal. But recently we spoke about the incident again and she told me that she’s now constantly afraid to get me angry in fear that I might hurt her or go further than just pushing her away. I love her and she’s the last person I want to hurt and it kills me that I’ve given her a reason to think these things. I just wanted to ask the question here firstly to see if you think this is a serious anger issue that would benefit from speaking to a therapist or going on a course or something. And if there’s anything I can do in the meantime to make things better. Maybe techniques that can calm me down. I genuinely don’t think I could ever hurt her, she is the most important thing in the world to me. But it scares me that I didn’t realise I had pushed her. All I want is to be someone that she feels safe around and to be the best I can be for her. Any help of advice would be much appreciated.

This all has started because I cant see my mother not getting respect from my father after staying with him for almost 30 years. I feel this so much , but I am not able to speak on this with either of them. I just keep on crying from inside. I cry while sleeping thinking of all this. This is affecting my behavior and I am no more a social person. I have lost all my friends. Even in office I just talk work. Some of my close friends say that I inspire them with the way I work, but when I come back home I just see all those things which I have seen over the years which makes me to forget the kind of person I am or I was to be. I have never got love. Because of all this my self esteem is gone way low.

Yet after all of this talk he turns right around to comfort me or help me out. Sometimes he tells me to do things I know i shouldn’t. such as challenge a higher class human (aka: adult) or even hurt someone or disobey rules. This ends in us bickering and me winning. He says he wants to take me to higher places that humans are to idiotic to understand. I believe him but.. if the occasion that this is untrue.. well.. I don’t want to get into trouble.

He tells me I’m a worthless person who was sent by him to kill as many as possible. I don’t listen to him of course. But it makes it really difficult for me to trust anyone. Mary is appearing much less than Adonis but she can make everything shake.

3036,5791,"Hello, I have a question about a severe case of violent daydreaming. I am a survivor of childhood abuse and have been suffering from violent daydreaming for more than 15 years. I vividly imagine myself or a third person being slowly killed by torture and can’t stop these thoughts. Since these fantasies involve very gory details, I am ashamed of them and don’t have the courage to describe them to anyone because I am afraid what people might think of me. The thoughts come by themselves in waves about twice a month and each wave lasts for about 3-5 days. During these days they slightly interfere with my normal social function as I experience typical sickness behavior (lethargy, depression, loss of appetite, sleepiness, reduction in grooming, hard to concentrate). Even if I try to concentrate on a task I feel like I can’t control my mind or how I generally feel during that time. I thought for a long time that I am the only person in the world having thoughts like that and there is no help for me but recently I thought I might try to search for answers. However, I could not find any information about this phenomenon. Can you please help me women tell me if there is any literature about this that could help me understand what is going on? Is there a type of therapy that specializes in these issues? What could I do to improve my condition?","('help', 'you', 'me')",help,0,Supportive Actions,Should statements,
3037,5801,"I found out my wife of 15 years was having an emotional affair with a friend of mine as a result of me being a poor husband. At what point do I stop trying to repair the damage? She has admitted the affair. She’s stating that she no longer speaks with him, but I question that. She is still very guarded of her phone, still friends with him on Facebook, etc. The reason she started the affair, and I’ve taken responsibility for this, was due to the fact that I put my work and mainly my hobbies ahead of my family for most of my marriage. I always thought she was supporting me in my hobby, but she says she was very unhappy.  And looking back I can see that now. Wish I had seen it then. However, she never told me point blank how unhappy she was. I found out about how unhappy she was about 3 months ago. I made wholesale changes in my life. I dropped my hobby right away. Starred spending as much time at home as I could. I put her and our daughter where they should have always been, first in my life. But something still seemed a little off. Then about 6 weeks into trying to work on our marriage( me doing most of the work, which I was fine with) I found out about this emotional affair. It devastated me. So now, another 6 weeks has passed. Things haven’t gotten much better. She says she’s done with him, but I question that as I said. I am still trying very hard to fix my mistakes and prove I’ve changed. However, I don’t feel she’s doing the same. My question is, because of my failures which I feel lead to the affair, should I be willing to give her more “time” to get to the point of working on her issues? It’s very difficult for me to handle the constant secrecy with her phone. I want to take it and see if she’s still contacting him, but I’m afraid that will crush any progress we may be making.

I am hurt that he feels this way, I am sad and I feel I don’t suffice.

3074,5845,"Often I’m troubled with specific lines from song verses and insults towards myself that get repeated in my head over and over again. Sometimes it won’t stop for forty five minutes to an hour. It happens at random times. For example, i’ll wake up in the morning with only the first line of a chorus stuck in my head and it’ll just keep repeating until it fades away on its own. The insults: I feel if I don’t repeatedly say them to myself out loud they’ll just repeat in my head like the song lyric. The insults are explicit and I don’t mean to call myself such derogatory things but I feel like they’re being directed at me by someone else in my head. I have to keep repeating them until I feel I don’t need to anymore. I do have terrible anxiety and both issues get worse when I’m more anxious than my baseline level of anxiety that’s always with me. I never feel like there’s a quiet moment in my head. Everything circulates so quickly that sometimes I can’t grab onto a full thought and I end up confusing myself on what i’m thinking or how i’m feeling. I can only sleep after I stay up so late that I exhaust myself completely and that’s when some of my brain slows down. I never know how i’m going to wake up feeling or “who”, in a sense, i’m going to wake up as. I feel as if that confusion also stems from the  rapid fire of thoughts always in my head. One moment i’m thinking of a fun memory, the next instant i’m thinking of death, then philosophy, then my future, then video games, then literature . . . it just goes on and on like someone repeatedly opens an encyclopedia, randomly points to a definition, then immediately flips to a different page and randomly chooses another definition before I could read the first definition. I’m never long on one thought. Could this be a product of anxiety? It’s both advantageous and bothersome as it makes me a quick thinker but not very good at focusing; it’s hard to read and I’ve got another semester coming this September.

Over time, I became addicted to removing myself from my skin in any way possible, I thank God that it hasn’t gotten bad enough to turn to anything harmful. I hate being — well — me, but this shell must still be maintained. For years I put the blame on everyone else and dug myself in a hole my first year of college.

My brother pretended it never happened and never touched me again. I grew up being in confused state whether or not I was abused. From childhood, I lacked self control for example I was eating continuously, watching T.V. continuously for 8 to 10 hours, neglecting my health. I was messed up and never told anyone about this. Right now I have cut off all my contact with my brother and my condition is getting worse after I realized and accepted I was sexually abused. My daily activities has been severely hampered and I can’t seem to take control of my life, I feel like I am possessed and control by someone else when I am staying alone.

Well, my psychiatrist thinks that they are just a way of me coping. Then that would mean that they aren’t real, but they are? I am so confused. My therapist has no clue. I feel like therapy just makes things worse, I end up completely “shutting down.” Medicines don’t help either. I don’t know what to do anymore.

3118,5883,"Hi, I’m new and I’m not sure whether my question belongs here but I don’t have anyone else to ask. My problem is that I’m worried that I don’t have any values or interests anymore. I used to follow a moral code, I was christian and rather conservative but liberal on some issues. I loved to read and create my own opinion on many topics. During high School, which was the worst time in my life, I have changed completely. Besides becoming first an atheist, than a satanist, I have also lost all of my interest in studying or making friends. We’ve had a teacher who spend a lot of time telling us that there is no good or bad, that everything in life is relative. I believed in everything she said, reading all the books she recommended but now as years have past, I really can’t live with myself anymore. Nothing matters to me, genocides, war, politics in general seem to be unimportant. I know it;s weird but I don’t feel like a human being anymore, I used to care for others, I wanted to change the world, help those in need but ever since I went to high school I feel like I’m just a body without a soul. I regret having my moral walls crushed by this teacher, and I regret the satanist phase and I would love to get back to my old self but I’m trying for years now and nothing really changes. If someone could explain what may have caused this change in my character and give me tips on how to find my old self back, I would really appreciate it. And sorry for my bad English, it’s a foreign language to me.","('believe', 'I', 'everything')",believe,1,Interpersonal Beliefs / Emotions,Mental filter,

First off, I’d noticed that she’d lost quite a bit of weight since winter break, at least 15-20 pounds off an already slender frame. It wasn’t just the weight, she hasn’t eaten lunch at school these past months either, and whenever we eat out somewhere on the weekends she hardly touches her plate even though she only orders a salad. Also, she always quickly types on her phone before eating — this is what compelled me to go on her notes, just to see if there was anything, and there was. She has a folder documenting her height and weights, morning and evening, with exact times, from the past 6 months; 5’4″ she started at 120lbs and is now down to 105lbs She also has weights labeled GW and UGW- 100 and 97, respectively. She has a folder in which she’s typed up rules for herself varying from “consume 200-800 calories daily” and “fast once a week”, to “exercise 30- 90 minutes 6X/week”. Also she has one labeled food journal but I didn’t get to look at it because I didn’t want to arouse suspicion for taking too long. Seeing this has shocked me, and since then I’ve been paying closer attention to her, and there’s something else that I find alarming, although I’m not sure what exactly it means.

I dream of saying smart or funny or sharp things just on the right time. I keep helping people on a big Facebook group of help, and wait for the people to thank me, or just know that others that see it know how smart I am and how funny and helpful. When I talk to people and they laugh, this is what makes me happy. It’s like all the things I do are done to be appreciated. It’s an addiction. Some of my life decisions were based on the will to be seen by people in a good way. My happiness depends on the approval of others!!! Even writing this question is for you to think how smart I am, and think of my poor situation. Can you give me self help ideas and book names to get out of this, and start discovering and doing what I WANT to do?

3163,5936,"I’m in my last year in high school and I have absolutely no friends. This problem of mine started around my freshman year. I had two childhood friends who I used to spend most of my days with since the second grade. After the transition from middle school to high school, they both have found different groups of friends, and I have lost all connection with them. I have found some substitutes for them, a group of people who I used to go to the same middle school with. I never really talked much with them until I had class with them. To this day, I would not really consider them friends, but more of acquaintances. I mainly just used them to have a group of friends to hang around with during lunch time. Around my sophmore year, I had detached myself from everyone in my school. I am just alone on my phone during lunch time, I don’t really talk to many people, the only time I do talk is when I am required to. I have looked into the Avoidant Personality Disorder symptoms, and they seem to line up perfectly with my personality. I feel like I shouldn’t talk to people because they won’t like me for being boring. I just sit home all day, mostly do independent activities all day like programming. The only friends I have are people I have met within the programming community. The only people I would feel comfortable around are the people who I feel I have some form of superiority over.I think the main cause of this is from my sister. She has talked down to everything I ever thought or have done ever since my early child hood. Everything from the music I listened to and even made fun of the types of friends I had at the time. I have confronted her with this and told her how I think this is the main reason for my mentality of being unaccepted by everyone, and she had stopped putting me down for everything for about a year now. The problem is, my social life doesn’t seem to be getting better. As I go through my senior year, it seems to be getting worse. I just need some beginners advice on what to do before this problem becomes permanent.

3164,5937,"Hi, I am 14 years old, and I have had problems pulling and messing with my hair in a variety of different ways since I was little. I noticed my grandma and mom also did this, I always told them to stop, until I noticed I did it too. I thought this was just a bad habit, until I stumbled across the word Trichotillomania online. I googled what it was and I found myself wondering if I had it. Only, I am not sure if I have it or not. I don’t exactly pull out my hair for the sensation of pulling it out. I pull/tug on the ends of my hair repeatedly to the extent where it tears split ends and as a result hair comes out. I get a weird satisfaction by pulling off my split ends which makes them worse. But, I am not sure if this classifies as Trichotillomania because I don’t notice balding, only minor thinning if that. I guess I mainly like the feeling of my hair getting pulled repeatedly and thats why I do it I am not sure. I have terrible split ends and sometimes the tugging on my scalp gives me headaches, but this doesn’t really match with the definition of Trichotillomania. I am not sure if this is a big deal or not, just multiple people have pointed it out, and I do it constantly. And when I say constantly I mean literally anytime my hands aren’t already doing something. I find myself doing this when I am bored or anxious. And considering I am anxious basically all the time it doesn’t really help.I recently found that playing with small magnetic balls during school helps me not pull. If you could help me identifiy if this is anything to be worried about it would be really helpful. Thanks.","('help', 'you', 'me')",help,0,Supportive Actions,Magnification,

3169,5941,"I’ve had social anxiety disorder most of my life and have coped with it well until it seems recently. Lately, I’m sad and upset all the time, I cry often over nothing more than my thoughts, I don’t get out of bed, and I’ve called out/left work early just to be alone. I feel numb or sad, and I also feel really worried that my boyfriend doesn’t like me anymore or is cheating (though he has given no reason for me to feel this way). I thought it was just anxiety at first, but this isn’t a panicky feeling, this is just utter despair. This is not the first time I’ve experienced this, but the last few times I thought it was circumstantial. Usually this lasts about a month or two before I go back to normal. However, last summer I experienced what may have been hypomania for a month and a half — I had sexual relations with multiple people in a short time, drank heavily every night, and didn’t sleep for a week and felt great. I thought I was on top of the world, that everyone loved me, and I could do anything I wanted. Now I feel utterly worthless, unwanted, unloved, and alone. At this particular moment in time, I feel awful about myself and my life, but I can’t sleep and I feel more awake than I’ve felt in weeks.

I can’t prepare my meals when he is in the kitchen or drink beverages he stands near for fear he’s breathed near them.

I can’t enter a room he’s been in without spraying an air freshener and I’ve not sat upon the couch for this very same reason. The thought of using the same utensils, regardless of how thoroughly it’s been washed, is absolutely revolting. If I know he’s used it, I cannot. I feel bad, as it must be heartbreaking for your own child to treat you like some sort of plague-victim, but I can’t help it. I have an extreme dislike of human smell, breath, saliva, and mouths in general-I can’t even watch scenes which incorporate close ups without feeling the need to not breathe or expel the air (exhale forcefully) contaminated by the screen-but it is at its extreme with him. I know it probably has something to do with our rather rocky relationship and the fact that, having grown up around him, I’m privy to his poor hygiene practices. As I’ve stated prior, I’ve felt this way from early adolescence, so perhaps these aspects aggravated an already-existent, admittedly irrational, hatred of the human mouth.

I ended up going to court for truancy and all of that. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder. I felt like my life was crumbling but I acted like it was okay.

In about October of 2014 I started going to an online school. Right when I started I knew it wouldn’t work out. And now I’m here, failing the 9th grade, completely friendless, I’m on medications and I’m going to therapy but I still can’t get my life together. I try my best to forget about by responsibilities by playing video games or watching TV. But it’s just becoming horrible.

3196,5968,"My husband of 18 years left a year ago, with no warning. He had demonstrated some strange behaviour during this time, but he is very secretive and deceitful and can hide things very well. Within a week of leaving his family of five children he lost his job. Prior to this he had been very successful in work. The past five years however he has changed jobs many times, although I don’t think I have been told the real reason. He now doesn’t see his children at all — one of these is a tiny baby and was less than three months when he left. Before this, he was a loving father. Since leaving he has not paid any financial support for his children although he is adamant that he has. He tells so many lies it is difficult to keep track. I believe that he believes his lies as he is so convincing. He tells lies that serve no purpose and are easily proven to be lies, yet he seems convinced they are true. He is also completely paranoid and accuses people of being out to get him. He comes from a family with an alcoholic father, which has never been acknowledged. My problem is that because we have split up, I have no influence over him at all. His family won’t acknowledge that there is a problem, even though his behavior is completely out of character. I risk looking like a bitter ex wife, even though I am extremely worried about him and I know something has happened to trigger this behavior. He has gone from being a well respected father and family man to not seeing any of his children or his old friends. He has tattooed himself which he would never have done and he has run up huge debts. I am worried he will end up arrested. He has had violent out bursts, but only towards me, as far as I know. Does it sound like he has a mental health problem? I truly believe he is delusional.","('believe', 'he', 'lies')",believe,1,Interpersonal Beliefs / Emotions,No Distortion,

I feel glad to be alive and I can’t wait act on the feelings. But I think I shouldn’t, and that’s why I’m submitting this question. So, how do I stop wanting to kill people? And is there something else that could make me feel the same way? I really like the feeling, and there isn’t much else that I like, so I don’t want to lose it.

3224,5986,"Your opinion? My partner is contradictory and critical, but at the same time gets very upset if any of her ideas or decisions are questioned in any way. Examples: She will ridicule any book I am reading unless it is one recommended by her. If it is not a subject that interests her, especially technical books, she will describe the book as childish rubbish. The same with any TV program or film. She is an aspirational vegetarian. If I have meat and she has vegetarian she has spent the evening — while I am eating — asking how I could eat dead rotting flesh, how do I feel having caused the death of  a living being just for my gratification etc. The following week she will buy, cook and eat chicken and say how tasty it is. Sex. This has now ceased. Very often she has not only rejected me, but says that I am disgusting for wanting sex, “Don’t come near me. Don’t you dare touch me”etc — almost hysterical. A couple of days later she will start crying and ask why don’t I make love to her any more, don’t I care for her? She will deny that she ever said that she did not want me near her. I thought that being nice to her would gain her trust and we would get closer. But it seems to have the opposite reaction. The nicer I am, the more awkward, contradictory and demanding she becomes. She seems to need to push me until we have a disagreement. My partner’s mother was English and her father Portuguese and she was brought up in Portugal.

She felt very left out, not coming from a rich family. My partner has two older brothers and mentions her poor relationship with them when she was a child.

3241,5999,"My son came home from Colorado and has been drinking and smoking pot for about a year. When he came home he was a little paranoid but ok. He went to see some friends and partied for 3 days, he said he only drank. When he came home he was hearing voices and uncontrollable we took him to a hosp. and they admitted him and gave him some medication. He went into outpatient therapy, but that was not helping with his problems he needed one on one. We went to a social worker and she said he wanted to hurt himself so she called cops and had him admitted. He was there for 10 days because he did not want to take meds. He’s in outpatient again and the doctor has him on 1mg at night and 10mg Abilify. I cut the abilify to 5mg because when he was on 10mg he heard more voices and holding his head all the time and not functioning. The doctor still thinks he should be on 5mg in morning and 5mg towards evening. We tried that and the next day he was so bad we thought we were going to bring him to the hosp. again. I called the office and they said the dr. Knows what he is doing and I should listen to them. When I did not give him the extra Abilify yesterday he seemed much calmer and wanted to do something. I am not sure what to do next I have been looking for other doctors but either they don’t take our insurance or they don’t have any openings for a few months. Is it possible someone age 30 can be ok and 3 days later be schizoaffective who never had any signs. And what medication is good.

After his girlfriend broke up with him his intrusions worsened. We repeatedly asked him to call before he came, but he would show up anyway and say “If you are busy I just go.” If we say we are busy he argues. Visits are often and prolonged. Finally, after waking us up one morning I firmly told him that he was asked to call and repeatedly violates our request. His first response was “You don’t like me.” I am also sick with Lupus and when this first big argument came I was caring for several children. He didn’t come unannounced nor even when invited for about 6 months and then out of the blue he started again. Then came the argument followed by absence then another 6 months all would start again. This cycle has been going on for about 5 years now. My husband and I explained why we needed him to call and he nodded his head as though he understood. After these talks I made sure to invite him over so that he would know he would be able to visit. His response is usually the same. “I may come, not sure what I am doing yet.” That ends up tying up our night as we don’t know if he is coming or not. If we invite others to play cards we may not be able to if he just shows up. Hubby feels guilty telling him that we are not up for company. It is badly straining our marriage as I can’t even rely on having a peaceful night. Hubby is stressed because he doesn’t want him doing it either but would put up with it if I didn’t complain. He also is extremely rude to us and other guests. He says and does mean things when he perceives an injustice towards him. Everything mean thing he does (which is often) seems to be calculated to send a message. The last 7 out of 8 invites we gave he caused issues. A pharmacist friend of mine told me to read “Controlling People” and I was shocked at how much scenarios in the book resembled this relative. How can I help my husband not feel guilty about insisting his uncle respect boundaries?

3287,6037,"From the U.S.: I’ve been diagnosed with OCD since summer of 2013 after I had 3 weeks of horrible intrusive thoughts, causing me to cry constantly. I started at 50mg of Zoloft, though soon I had to up it to 75mg then 100mg. I’ve been doing okay with the 100mg, though sometimes I forget to take it. The reason it all started (What I believe…) is after seeing the movie “The Conjuring.” It messed with me, made me afraid of possession or going crazy and hurting someone I love. I still am afraid of these things, but not as much. I haven’t watched any scary movies, but I’ve seen previews and they cause my anxiety to go out the roof. Its 11:17pm right now and I am tired but I’m not laying down because I am still afraid, except its slightly different. Lately, I’ve been feeling like someone is watching me, like a ghost (Lately, meaning in the past week this started.) and I don’t hear any voices or anything but I’m so afraid that I could be going crazy or something, it scares me so much. It may be because I haven’t been taking my Zoloft constantly, not that I ignore it, I honestly forget to take it. I went to my doctor last Monday and everything was okay, what should I do? Should I make another apt? I’ve also had therapy, it did help a lot. Should I go back to therapy? Please let me know, I want a professional opinion before I freak even more out.

3296,6045,"Since I can remember, I’ve always thought of myself as unattractive. At school I was considered undesirable and teased indirectly about my looks. In my later teens men started taking an interest and I became sexually active and happy, eventually entering my first relationship which lasted 4 years. This relationship ended about a year ago and though I am over it, my ex dragged out the ending and it became quite bitter with another woman involved. He would openly compare me to her and make comparisons and refused to kiss me but also would not end the relationship and have very unemotional sex with me – as though I were an object. He began making direct comments about my lack of attractiveness and eventually I left. A month or so after that, I slept with one man after a date in a dark room. Since then, I have been unable to be naked around myself or others. I cannot look at myself in the mirror and my sex life has completely stopped as I can’t be intimate unless the room is pitch black, I have clothes on and I don’t know the guy. It’s been almost a year since I last had any sexual contact with anyone and it’s upsetting me greatly. I worry I won’t ever be able to be naked or intimate with anyone again. The problem has progressed – I have always been nervous of spending time with just one person unless I know them extremely well as I fear awkward silences or general awkwardness.

I constantly ask her not to go out alone, in the fear of losing her. I get so worried whenever she is sick or just catches a minor cold. My dad and I were never that close. I tried telling him how I feel but he dismissed it. When my mother is out alone, I keep on thinking what if something happens to her while she is on the road. I imagine all possible situations and I end up having crying spells. All throughout those hours I fail to concentrate on anything productive. I even discarded the idea of studying outside my State.

Four years ago I met a boy and we are dating since then, he is my entire life and he is amazing to me. My family hate him but they didn’t met him at all, they hate his parents so they don’t agree on this relationship and they talk about him in a very bad way and that hurts me so much. I tried to talk to them but they think that I’m in love with him so I don’t think correctly, I’m seeing him behind their back and I lie on them every day and when they find out they become so mad, my sister met him and she likes him and they became friends, but she is afraid to tell my parents. In addition, he is a short guy so they make fun of this every time.","('love', 'I', 'family')",love,1,Interpersonal Beliefs / Emotions,Magnification,
